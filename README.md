| 551 | InteractAvatar: Modeling Hand-Face Interaction in Photorealistic Avatars with Deformable Gaussians | Kefan Chen,Sergiu Oprea,Justin Theiss,Sreyas Mohan,Srinath Sridhar,Aayush Prakash | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the rising interest from the community in digital avatars coupled with the importance of expressions and gestures in communication, modeling natural avatar behavior remains an important challenge across many industries such as teleconferencing, gaming, and AR/VR. Human hands are the primary tool for interacting with the environment and essential for realistic human behavior modeling, yet existing 3D hand and head avatar models often overlook the crucial aspect of hand-body interactions, such as between hand and face. We present InteracttAvatar, the first model to faithfully capture the photorealistic appearance of dynamic hand and non-rigid hand-face interactions. Our novel Dynamic Gaussian Hand model, combining template model and 3D Gaussian Splatting as well as a dynamic refinement module, captures pose-dependent change, e.g. the fine wrinkles and complex shadows that occur during articulation. Importantly, our hand-face interaction module models the subtle geometry and appearance dynamics that underlie common gestures. Through experiments of novel view synthesis, self reenactment and cross-identity reenactment, we demonstrate that InteracttAvatar can reconstruct hand and hand-face interactions from monocular or multiview videos with high-fidelity details and be animated with novel poses.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07949](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07949) |
| 550 | Stochastic Ray Tracing of 3D Transparent Gaussians | Xin Sun,Iliyan Georgiev,Yun Fei,Milo\xc5\xa1 Ha\xc5\xa1an | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian splatting has recently been widely adopted as a 3D representation for novel-view synthesis, relighting, and text-to-3D generation tasks, offering realistic and detailed results through a collection of explicit 3D Gaussians carrying opacities and view-dependent colors. However, efficient rendering of many transparent primitives remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches either rasterize the 3D Gaussians with approximate sorting per view or rely on high-end RTX GPUs to exhaustively process all ray-Gaussian intersections (bounding Gaussians by meshes). This paper proposes a stochastic ray tracing method to render 3D clouds of transparent primitives. Instead of processing all ray-Gaussian intersections in sequential order, each ray traverses the acceleration structure only once, randomly accepting and shading a single intersection (or N intersections, using a simple extension). This approach minimizes shading time and avoids sorting the Gaussians along the ray while minimizing the register usage and maximizing parallelism even on low-end GPUs. The cost of rays through the Gaussian asset is comparable to that of standard mesh-intersection rays. While our method introduces noise, the shading is unbiased, and the variance is slight, as stochastic acceptance is importance-sampled based on accumulated opacity. The alignment with the Monte Carlo philosophy simplifies implementation and easily integrates our method into a conventional path-tracing framework.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06598) |
| 549 | GSDeformer: Direct, Real-time and Extensible Cage-based Deformation for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Jiajun Huang,Shuolin Xu,Hongchuan Yu,Tong-Yee Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present GSDeformer, a method that enables cage-based deformation on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach bridges cage-based deformation and 3DGS by using a proxy point-cloud representation. This point cloud is generated from 3D Gaussians, and deformations applied to the point cloud are translated into transformations on the 3D Gaussians. To handle potential bending caused by deformation, we incorporate a splitting process to approximate it. Our method does not modify or extend the core architecture of 3D Gaussian Splatting, making it compatible with any trained vanilla 3DGS or its variants. Additionally, we automate cage construction for 3DGS and its variants using a render-and-reconstruct approach. Experiments demonstrate that GSDeformer delivers superior deformation results compared to existing methods, is robust under extreme deformations, requires no retraining for editing, runs in real-time, and can be extended to other 3DGS variants.

| 548 | View-Dependent Uncertainty Estimation of 3D Gaussian Splatting | Chenyu Han,Corentin Dumery | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become increasingly popular in 3D scene reconstruction for its high visual accuracy. However, uncertainty estimation of 3DGS scenes remains underexplored and is crucial to downstream tasks such as asset extraction and scene completion. Since the appearance of 3D gaussians is view-dependent, the color of a gaussian can thus be certain from an angle and uncertain from another. We thus propose to model uncertainty in 3DGS as an additional view-dependent per-gaussian feature that can be modeled with spherical harmonics. This simple yet effective modeling is easily interpretable and can be integrated into the traditional 3DGS pipeline. It is also significantly faster than ensemble methods while maintaining high accuracy, as demonstrated in our experiments.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07370](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07370) |
| 547 | Wheat3DGS: In-field 3D Reconstruction, Instance Segmentation and Phenotyping of Wheat Heads with Gaussian Splatting | Daiwei Zhang,Joaquin Gajardo,Tomislav Medic,Isinsu Katircioglu,Mike Boss,Norbert Kirchgessner,Achim Walter,Lukas Roth | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Automated extraction of plant morphological traits is crucial for supporting crop breeding and agricultural management through high-throughput field phenotyping (HTFP). Solutions based on multi-view RGB images are attractive due to their scalability and affordability, enabling volumetric measurements that 2D approaches cannot directly capture. While advanced methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown promise, their application has been limited to counting or extracting traits from only a few plants or organs. Furthermore, accurately measuring complex structures like individual wheat heads-essential for studying crop yields-remains particularly challenging due to occlusions and the dense arrangement of crop canopies in field conditions. The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising alternative for HTFP due to its high-quality reconstructions and explicit point-based representation. In this paper, we present Wheat3DGS, a novel approach that leverages 3DGS and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise 3D instance segmentation and morphological measurement of hundreds of wheat heads automatically, representing the first application of 3DGS to HTFP. We validate the accuracy of wheat head extraction against high-resolution laser scan data, obtaining per-instance mean absolute percentage errors of 15.1%, 18.3%, and 40.2% for length, width, and volume. We provide additional comparisons to NeRF-based approaches and traditional Muti-View Stereo (MVS), demonstrating superior results. Our approach enables rapid, non-destructive measurements of key yield-related traits at scale, with significant implications for accelerating crop breeding and improving our understanding of wheat development.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06978](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06978) |
| 546 | FIORD: A Fisheye Indoor-Outdoor Dataset with LIDAR Ground Truth for 3D Scene Reconstruction and Benchmarking | Ulas Gunes,Matias Turkulainen,Xuqian Ren,Arno Solin,Juho Kannala,Esa Rahtu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The development of large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis methods mostly rely on datasets comprising perspective images with narrow fields of view (FoV). While effective for small-scale scenes, these datasets require large image sets and extensive structure-from-motion (SfM) processing, limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a fisheye image dataset tailored for scene reconstruction tasks. Using dual 200-degree fisheye lenses, our dataset provides full 360-degree coverage of 5 indoor and 5 outdoor scenes. Each scene has sparse SfM point clouds and precise LIDAR-derived dense point clouds that can be used as geometric ground-truth, enabling robust benchmarking under challenging conditions such as occlusions and reflections. While the baseline experiments focus on vanilla Gaussian Splatting and NeRF based Nerfacto methods, the dataset supports diverse approaches for scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and image-based rendering.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01732](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01732) |
| 545 | SGSST: Scaling Gaussian Splatting StyleTransfer | Bruno Galerne,Jianling Wang,Lara Raad,Jean-Michel Morel | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Applying style transfer to a full 3D environment is a challenging task that has seen many developments since the advent of neural rendering. 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently pushed further many limits of neural rendering in terms of training speed and reconstruction quality. This work introduces SGSST: Scaling Gaussian Splatting Style Transfer, an optimization-based method to apply style transfer to pretrained 3DGS scenes. We demonstrate that a new multiscale loss based on global neural statistics, that we name SOS for Simultaneously Optimized Scales, enables style transfer to ultra-high resolution 3D scenes. Not only SGSST pioneers 3D scene style transfer at such high image resolutions, it also produces superior visual quality as assessed by thorough qualitative, quantitative and perceptual comparisons.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03371](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03371) |
| 544 | IAAO: Interactive Affordance Learning for Articulated Objects in 3D Environments | Can Zhang,Gim Hee Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This work presents IAAO, a novel framework that builds an explicit 3D model for intelligent agents to gain understanding of articulated objects in their environment through interaction. Unlike prior methods that rely on task-specific networks and assumptions about movable parts, our IAAO leverages large foundation models to estimate interactive affordances and part articulations in three stages. We first build hierarchical features and label fields for each object state using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by distilling mask features and view-consistent labels from multi-view images. We then perform object- and part-level queries on the 3D Gaussian primitives to identify static and articulated elements, estimating global transformations and local articulation parameters along with affordances. Finally, scenes from different states are merged and refined based on the estimated transformations, enabling robust affordance-based interaction and manipulation of objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06827](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06827) |
| 543 | SVG-IR: Spatially-Varying Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering | Hanxiao Sun,YuPeng Gao,Jin Xie,Jian Yang,Beibei Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing 3D assets from images, known as inverse rendering (IR), remains a challenging task due to its ill-posed nature. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities for novel view synthesis (NVS) tasks. Methods apply it to relighting by separating radiance into BRDF parameters and lighting, yet produce inferior relighting quality with artifacts and unnatural indirect illumination due to the limited capability of each Gaussian, which has constant material parameters and normal, alongside the absence of physical constraints for indirect lighting. In this paper, we present a novel framework called Spatially-vayring Gaussian Inverse Rendering (SVG-IR), aimed at enhancing both NVS and relighting quality. To this end, we propose a new representation-Spatially-varying Gaussian (SVG)-that allows per-Gaussian spatially varying parameters. This enhanced representation is complemented by a SVG splatting scheme akin to vertex/fragment shading in traditional graphics pipelines. Furthermore, we integrate a physically-based indirect lighting model, enabling more realistic relighting. The proposed SVG-IR framework significantly improves rendering quality, outperforming state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods by 2.5 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and surpassing existing Gaussian-based techniques by 3.5 dB in relighting tasks, all while maintaining a real-time rendering speed.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06815](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06815) |
| 542 | GSta: Efficient Training Scheme with Siestaed Gaussians for Monocular 3D Scene Reconstruction | Anil Armagan,Albert Sa\xc3\xa0-Garriga,Bruno Manganelli,Kyuwon Kim,M. Kerim Yucel | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian Splatting (GS) is a popular approach for 3D reconstruction, mostly due to its ability to converge reasonably fast, faithfully represent the scene and render (novel) views in a fast fashion. However, it suffers from large storage and memory requirements, and its training speed still lags behind the hash-grid based radiance field approaches (e.g. Instant-NGP), which makes it especially difficult to deploy them in robotics scenarios, where 3D reconstruction is crucial for accurate operation. In this paper, we propose GSta that dynamically identifies Gaussians that have converged well during training, based on their positional and color gradient norms. By forcing such Gaussians into a siesta and stopping their updates (freezing) during training, we improve training speed with competitive accuracy compared to state of the art. We also propose an early stopping mechanism based on the PSNR values computed on a subset of training images. Combined with other improvements, such as integrating a learning rate scheduler, GSta achieves an improved Pareto front in convergence speed, memory and storage requirements, while preserving quality. We also show that GSta can improve other methods and complement orthogonal approaches in efficiency improvement; once combined with Trick-GS, GSta achieves up to 5x faster training, 16x smaller disk size compared to vanilla GS, while having comparable accuracy and consuming only half the peak memory.

| 541 | Collision avoidance from monocular vision trained with novel view synthesis | Valentin Tordjman--Levavasseur,St\xc3\xa9phane Caron | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Collision avoidance can be checked in explicit environment models such as elevation maps or occupancy grids, yet integrating such models with a locomotion policy requires accurate state estimation. In this work, we consider the question of collision avoidance from an implicit environment model. We use monocular RGB images as inputs and train a collisionavoidance policy from photorealistic images generated by 2D Gaussian splatting. We evaluate the resulting pipeline in realworld experiments under velocity commands that bring the robot on an intercept course with obstacles. Our results suggest that RGB images can be enough to make collision-avoidance decisions, both in the room where training data was collected and in out-of-distribution environments.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06651](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06651) |
| 540 | LeanGaussian: Breaking Pixel or Point Cloud Correspondence in Modeling 3D Gaussians | Jiamin Wu,Kenkun Liu,Han Gao,Xiaoke Jiang,Yao Yuan,Lei Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, Gaussian splatting has demonstrated significant success in novel view synthesis. Current methods often regress Gaussians with pixel or point cloud correspondence, linking each Gaussian with a pixel or a 3D point. This leads to the redundancy of Gaussians being used to overfit the correspondence rather than the objects represented by the 3D Gaussians themselves, consequently wasting resources and lacking accurate geometries or textures. In this paper, we introduce LeanGaussian, a novel approach that treats each query in deformable Transformer as one 3D Gaussian ellipsoid, breaking the pixel or point cloud correspondence constraints. We leverage deformable decoder to iteratively refine the Gaussians layer-by-layer with the image features as keys and values. Notably, the center of each 3D Gaussian is defined as 3D reference points, which are then projected onto the image for deformable attention in 2D space. On both the ShapeNet SRN dataset (category level) and the Google Scanned Objects dataset (open-category level, trained with the Objaverse dataset), our approach, outperforms prior methods by approximately 6.1%, achieving a PSNR of 25.44 and 22.36, respectively. Additionally, our method achieves a 3D reconstruction speed of 7.2 FPS and rendering speed 500 FPS. Codes are available at https://github.com/jwubz123/LeanGaussian.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16323](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16323) |
| 539 | Sort-free Gaussian Splatting via Weighted Sum Rendering | Qiqi Hou,Randall Rauwendaal,Zifeng Li,Hoang Le,Farzad Farhadzadeh,Fatih Porikli,Alexei Bourd,Amir Said | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a significant advancement in 3D scene reconstruction, attracting considerable attention due to its ability to recover high-fidelity details while maintaining low complexity. Despite the promising results achieved by 3DGS, its rendering performance is constrained by its dependence on costly non-commutative alpha-blending operations. These operations mandate complex view dependent sorting operations that introduce computational overhead, especially on the resource-constrained platforms such as mobile phones. In this paper, we propose Weighted Sum Rendering, which approximates alpha blending with weighted sums, thereby removing the need for sorting. This simplifies implementation, delivers superior performance, and eliminates the "popping" artifacts caused by sorting. Experimental results show that optimizing a generalized Gaussian splatting formulation to the new differentiable rendering yields competitive image quality. The method was implemented and tested in a mobile device GPU, achieving on average $1.23\\times$ faster rendering.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18931](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18931) |
| 538 | Compressing 3D Gaussian Splatting by Noise-Substituted Vector Quantization | Haishan Wang,Mohammad Hassan Vali,Arno Solin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in 3D reconstruction, achieving high-quality results with real-time radiance field rendering. However, a key challenge is the substantial storage cost: reconstructing a single scene typically requires millions of Gaussian splats, each represented by 59 floating-point parameters, resulting in approximately 1 GB of memory. To address this challenge, we propose a compression method by building separate attribute codebooks and storing only discrete code indices. Specifically, we employ noise-substituted vector quantization technique to jointly train the codebooks and model features, ensuring consistency between gradient descent optimization and parameter discretization. Our method reduces the memory consumption efficiently (around $45\\times$) while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality on standard 3D benchmark scenes. Experiments on different codebook sizes show the trade-off between compression ratio and image quality. Furthermore, the trained compressed model remains fully compatible with popular 3DGS viewers and enables faster rendering speed, making it well-suited for practical applications.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03059](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03059) |
| 537 | DCSEG: Decoupled 3D Open-Set Segmentation using Gaussian Splatting | Luis Wiedmann,Luca Wiehe,David Rozenberszki | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Open-set 3D segmentation represents a major point of interest for multiple downstream robotics and augmented/virtual reality applications. We present a decoupled 3D segmentation pipeline to ensure modularity and adaptability to novel 3D representations as well as semantic segmentation foundation models. We first reconstruct a scene with 3D Gaussians and learn class-agnostic features through contrastive supervision from a 2D instance proposal network. These 3D features are then clustered to form coarse object- or part-level masks. Finally, we match each 3D cluster to class-aware masks predicted by a 2D open-vocabulary segmentation model, assigning semantic labels without retraining the 3D representation. Our decoupled design (1) provides a plug-and-play interface for swapping different 2D or 3D modules, (2) ensures multi-object instance segmentation at no extra cost, and (3) leverages rich 3D geometry for robust scene understanding. We evaluate on synthetic and real-world indoor datasets, demonstrating improved performance over comparable NeRF-based pipelines on mIoU and mAcc, particularly for challenging or long-tail classes. We also show how varying the 2D backbone affects the final segmentation, highlighting the modularity of our framework. These results confirm that decoupling 3D mask proposal and semantic classification can deliver flexible, efficient, and open-vocabulary 3D segmentation.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10972](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10972) |
| 536 | ActiveGS: Active Scene Reconstruction Using Gaussian Splatting | Liren Jin,Xingguang Zhong,Yue Pan,Jens Behley,Cyrill Stachniss,Marija Popovi\xc4\x87 | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Robotics applications often rely on scene reconstructions to enable downstream tasks. In this work, we tackle the challenge of actively building an accurate map of an unknown scene using an RGB-D camera on a mobile platform. We propose a hybrid map representation that combines a Gaussian splatting map with a coarse voxel map, leveraging the strengths of both representations: the high-fidelity scene reconstruction capabilities of Gaussian splatting and the spatial modelling strengths of the voxel map. At the core of our framework is an effective confidence modelling technique for the Gaussian splatting map to identify under-reconstructed areas, while utilising spatial information from the voxel map to target unexplored areas and assist in collision-free path planning. By actively collecting scene information in under-reconstructed and unexplored areas for map updates, our approach achieves superior Gaussian splatting reconstruction results compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, we demonstrate the real-world applicability of our framework using an unmanned aerial vehicle.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17769](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17769) |
| 535 | ProtoGS: Efficient and High-Quality Rendering with 3D Gaussian Prototypes | Zhengqing Gao,Dongting Hu,Jia-Wang Bian,Huan Fu,Yan Li,Tongliang Liu,Mingming Gong,Kun Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made significant strides in novel view synthesis but is limited by the substantial number of Gaussian primitives required, posing challenges for deployment on lightweight devices. Recent methods address this issue by compressing the storage size of densified Gaussians, yet fail to preserve rendering quality and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose ProtoGS to learn Gaussian prototypes to represent Gaussian primitives, significantly reducing the total Gaussian amount without sacrificing visual quality. Our method directly uses Gaussian prototypes to enable efficient rendering and leverage the resulting reconstruction loss to guide prototype learning. To further optimize memory efficiency during training, we incorporate structure-from-motion (SfM) points as anchor points to group Gaussian primitives. Gaussian prototypes are derived within each group by clustering of K-means, and both the anchor points and the prototypes are optimized jointly. Our experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets prove that we outperform existing methods, achieving a substantial reduction in the number of Gaussians, and enabling high rendering speed while maintaining or even enhancing rendering fidelity.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17486](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17486) |
| 534 | Micro-splatting: Maximizing Isotropic Constraints for Refined Optimization in 3D Gaussian Splatting | Jee Won Lee,Hansol Lim,Sooyeun Yang,Jongseong Choi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have achieved impressive scalability and real-time rendering for large-scale scenes but often fall short in capturing fine-grained details. Conventional approaches that rely on relatively large covariance parameters tend to produce blurred representations, while directly reducing covariance sizes leads to sparsity. In this work, we introduce Micro-splatting (Maximizing Isotropic Constraints for Refined Optimization in 3D Gaussian Splatting), a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach leverages a covariance regularization term to penalize excessively large Gaussians to ensure each splat remains compact and isotropic. This work implements an adaptive densification strategy that dynamically refines regions with high image gradients by lowering the splitting threshold, followed by loss function enhancement. This strategy results in a denser and more detailed gaussian means where needed, without sacrificing rendering efficiency. Quantitative evaluations using metrics such as L1, L2, PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, alongside qualitative comparisons demonstrate that our method significantly enhances fine-details in 3D reconstructions.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05740](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05740) |
| 533 | PBR-NeRF: Inverse Rendering with Physics-Based Neural Fields | Sean Wu,Shamik Basu,Tim Broedermann,Luc Van Gool,Christos Sakaridis | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We tackle the ill-posed inverse rendering problem in 3D reconstruction with a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) approach informed by Physics-Based Rendering (PBR) theory, named PBR-NeRF. Our method addresses a key limitation in most NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches: they estimate view-dependent appearance without modeling scene materials and illumination. To address this limitation, we present an inverse rendering (IR) model capable of jointly estimating scene geometry, materials, and illumination. Our model builds upon recent NeRF-based IR approaches, but crucially introduces two novel physics-based priors that better constrain the IR estimation. Our priors are rigorously formulated as intuitive loss terms and achieve state-of-the-art material estimation without compromising novel view synthesis quality. Our method is easily adaptable to other inverse rendering and 3D reconstruction frameworks that require material estimation. We demonstrate the importance of extending current neural rendering approaches to fully model scene properties beyond geometry and view-dependent appearance.

| 532 | View-Dependent Deformation Fields for 2D Editing of 3D Models | Martin El Mqirmi,Noam Aigerman | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose a method for authoring non-realistic 3D objects (represented as either 3D Gaussian Splats or meshes), that comply with 2D edits from specific viewpoints. Namely, given a 3D object, a user chooses different viewpoints and interactively deforms the object in the 2D image plane of each view. The method then produces a "deformation field" - an interpolation between those 2D deformations in a smooth manner as the viewpoint changes. Our core observation is that the 2D deformations do not need to be tied to an underlying object, nor share the same deformation space. We use this observation to devise a method for authoring view-dependent deformations, holding several technical contributions: first, a novel way to compositionality-blend between the 2D deformations after lifting them to 3D - this enables the user to "stack" the deformations similarly to layers in an editing software, each deformation operating on the results of the previous; second, a novel method to apply the 3D deformation to 3D Gaussian Splats; third, an approach to author the 2D deformations, by deforming a 2D mesh encapsulating a rendered image of the object. We show the versatility and efficacy of our method by adding cartoonish effects to objects, providing means to modify human characters, fitting 3D models to given 2D sketches and caricatures, resolving occlusions, and recreating classic non-realistic paintings as 3D models.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05544](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05544) |
| 531 | L3GS: Layered 3D Gaussian Splats for Efficient 3D Scene Delivery | Yi-Zhen Tsai,Xuechen Zhang,Zheng Li,Jiasi Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Traditional 3D content representations include dense point clouds that consume large amounts of data and hence network bandwidth, while newer representations such as neural radiance fields suffer from poor frame rates due to their non-standard volumetric rendering pipeline. 3D Gaussian splats (3DGS) can be seen as a generalization of point clouds that meet the best of both worlds, with high visual quality and efficient rendering for real-time frame rates. However, delivering 3DGS scenes from a hosting server to client devices is still challenging due to high network data consumption (e.g., 1.5 GB for a single scene). The goal of this work is to create an efficient 3D content delivery framework that allows users to view high quality 3D scenes with 3DGS as the underlying data representation. The main contributions of the paper are: (1) Creating new layered 3DGS scenes for efficient delivery, (2) Scheduling algorithms to choose what splats to download at what time, and (3) Trace-driven experiments from users wearing virtual reality headsets to evaluate the visual quality and latency. Our system for Layered 3D Gaussian Splats delivery L3GS demonstrates high visual quality, achieving 16.9% higher average SSIM compared to baselines, and also works with other compressed 3DGS representations.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05517](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05517) |
| 530 | Let it Snow! Animating Static Gaussian Scenes With Dynamic Weather Effects | Gal Fiebelman,Hadar Averbuch-Elor,Sagie Benaim | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting has recently enabled fast and photorealistic reconstruction of static 3D scenes. However, introducing dynamic elements that interact naturally with such static scenes remains challenging. Accordingly, we present a novel hybrid framework that combines Gaussian-particle representations for incorporating physically-based global weather effects into static 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes, correctly handling the interactions of dynamic elements with the static scene. We follow a three-stage process: we first map static 3D Gaussians to a particle-based representation. We then introduce dynamic particles and simulate their motion using the Material Point Method (MPM). Finally, we map the simulated particles back to the Gaussian domain while introducing appearance parameters tailored for specific effects. To correctly handle the interactions of dynamic elements with the static scene, we introduce specialized collision handling techniques. Our approach supports a variety of weather effects, including snowfall, rainfall, fog, and sandstorms, and can also support falling objects, all with physically plausible motion and appearance.

However, current methods often generate low-quality textures and inconsistent 3D structures. This is especially true when extrapolating significantly beyond the field of view of the reference image. To address these challenges, we propose PanoDreamer, a novel framework for consistent, 3D scene generation with flexible text and image control. Our approach employs a large language model and a warp-refine pipeline, first generating an initial set of images and then compositing them into a 360-degree panorama. This panorama is then lifted into 3D to form an initial point cloud. We then use several approaches to generate additional images, from different viewpoints, that are consistent with the initial point cloud and expand/refine the initial point cloud. Given the resulting set of images, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to create the final 3D scene, which can then be rendered from different viewpoints. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PanoDreamer in generating high-quality, geometrically consistent 3D scenes.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05152](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05152) |
| 528 | RNG: Relightable Neural Gaussians | Jiahui Fan,Fujun Luan,Jian Yang,Milo\xc5\xa1 Ha\xc5\xa1an,Beibei Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown impressive results for the novel view synthesis task, where lighting is assumed to be fixed. However, creating relightable 3D assets, especially for objects with ill-defined shapes (fur, fabric, etc.), remains a challenging task. The decomposition between light, geometry, and material is ambiguous, especially if either smooth surface assumptions or surfacebased analytical shading models do not apply. We propose Relightable Neural Gaussians (RNG), a novel 3DGS-based framework that enables the relighting of objects with both hard surfaces or soft boundaries, while avoiding assumptions on the shading model. We condition the radiance at each point on both view and light directions. We also introduce a shadow cue, as well as a depth refinement network to improve shadow accuracy. Finally, we propose a hybrid forward-deferred fitting strategy to balance geometry and appearance quality. Our method achieves significantly faster training (1.3 hours) and rendering (60 frames per second) compared to a prior method based on neural radiance fields and produces higher-quality shadows than a concurrent 3DGS-based method.

| 527 | 3D Gaussian Particle Approximation of VDB Datasets: A Study for Scientific Visualization | Isha Sharma,Dieter Schmalstieg | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The complexity and scale of Volumetric and Simulation datasets for Scientific Visualization(SciVis) continue to grow. And the approaches and advantages of memory-efficient data formats and storage techniques for such datasets vary. OpenVDB library and its VDB data format excels in memory efficiency through its hierarchical and dynamic tree structure, with active and inactive sub-trees for data storage. It is heavily used in current production renderers for both animation and rendering stages in VFX pipelines and photorealistic rendering of volumes and fluids. However, it still remains to be fully leveraged in SciVis where domains dealing with sparse scalar fields like porous media, time varying volumes such as tornado and weather simulation or high resolution simulation of Computational Fluid Dynamics present ample number of large challenging data sets.Goal of this paper is not only to explore the use of OpenVDB in SciVis but also to explore a level of detail(LOD) technique using 3D Gaussian particles approximating voxel regions. For rendering, we utilize NVIDIA OptiX library for ray marching through the Gaussians particles. Data modeling using 3D Gaussians has been very popular lately due to success in stereoscopic image to 3D scene conversion using Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian approximation and mixture models aren't entirely new in SciVis as well. Our work explores the integration with rendering software libraries like OpenVDB and OptiX to take advantage of their built-in memory compaction and hardware acceleration features, while also leveraging the performance capabilities of modern GPUs. Thus, we present a SciVis rendering approach that uses 3D Gaussians at varying LOD in a lossy scheme derived from VDB datasets, rather than focusing on photorealistic volume rendering.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04857](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04857) |
| 526 | Embracing Dynamics: Dynamics-aware 4D Gaussian Splatting SLAM | Zhicong Sun,Jacqueline Lo,Jinxing Hu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology now has photorealistic mapping capabilities thanks to the real-time high-fidelity rendering capability of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). However, due to the static representation of scenes, current 3DGS-based SLAM encounters issues with pose drift and failure to reconstruct accurate maps in dynamic environments. To address this problem, we present D4DGS-SLAM, the first SLAM method based on 4DGS map representation for dynamic environments. By incorporating the temporal dimension into scene representation, D4DGS-SLAM enables high-quality reconstruction of dynamic scenes. Utilizing the dynamics-aware InfoModule, we can obtain the dynamics, visibility, and reliability of scene points, and filter stable static points for tracking accordingly. When optimizing Gaussian points, we apply different isotropic regularization terms to Gaussians with varying dynamic characteristics. Experimental results on real-world dynamic scene datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both camera pose tracking and map quality.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04844](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04844) |
| 525 | DeclutterNeRF: Generative-Free 3D Scene Recovery for Occlusion Removal | Wanzhou Liu,Zhexiao Xiong,Xinyu Li,Nathan Jacobs | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent novel view synthesis (NVS) techniques, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly advanced 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality rendering and realistic detail recovery. Effectively removing occlusions while preserving scene details can further enhance the robustness and applicability of these techniques. However, existing approaches for object and occlusion removal predominantly rely on generative priors, which, despite filling the resulting holes, introduce new artifacts and blurriness. Moreover, existing benchmark datasets for evaluating occlusion removal methods lack realistic complexity and viewpoint variations. To address these issues, we introduce DeclutterSet, a novel dataset featuring diverse scenes with pronounced occlusions distributed across foreground, midground, and background, exhibiting substantial relative motion across viewpoints. We further introduce DeclutterNeRF, an occlusion removal method free from generative priors. DeclutterNeRF introduces joint multi-view optimization of learnable camera parameters, occlusion annealing regularization, and employs an explainable stochastic structural similarity loss, ensuring high-quality, artifact-free reconstructions from incomplete images. Experiments demonstrate that DeclutterNeRF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on our proposed DeclutterSet, establishing a strong baseline for future research.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04679](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04679) |

However, existing data collection methods like teleoperation are slow, prone to control delays, and unsuitable for dynamic tasks. In contrast, human natural data, where humans directly perform tasks with tools, offers natural, unstructured interactions that are both efficient and easy to collect. Building on the insight that humans and robots can share the same tools, we propose a framework to transfer tool-use knowledge from human data to robots. Using two RGB cameras, our method generates 3D reconstruction, applies Gaussian splatting for novel view augmentation, employs segmentation models to extract embodiment-agnostic observations, and leverages task-space tool-action representations to train visuomotor policies. We validate our approach on diverse real-world tasks, including meatball scooping, pan flipping, wine bottle balancing, and other complex tasks. Our method achieves a 71\\% higher average success rate compared to diffusion policies trained with teleoperation data and reduces data collection time by 77\\%, with some tasks solvable only by our framework. Compared to hand-held gripper, our method cuts data collection time by 41\\%. Additionally, our method bridges the embodiment gap, improves robustness to variations in camera viewpoints and robot configurations, and generalizes effectively across objects and spatial setups.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04612](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04612) |
| 523 | Thermoxels: a voxel-based method to generate simulation-ready 3D thermal models | Etienne Chassaing,Florent Forest,Olga Fink,Malcolm Mielle | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In the European Union, buildings account for 42% of energy use and 35% of greenhouse gas emissions. Since most existing buildings will still be in use by 2050, retrofitting is crucial for emissions reduction. However, current building assessment methods rely mainly on qualitative thermal imaging, which limits data-driven decisions for energy savings. On the other hand, quantitative assessments using finite element analysis (FEA) offer precise insights but require manual CAD design, which is tedious and error-prone. Recent advances in 3D reconstruction, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, enable precise 3D modeling from sparse images but lack clearly defined volumes and the interfaces between them needed for FEA. We propose Thermoxels, a novel voxel-based method able to generate FEA-compatible models, including both geometry and temperature, from a sparse set of RGB and thermal images. Using pairs of RGB and thermal images as input, Thermoxels represents a scene's geometry as a set of voxels comprising color and temperature information. After optimization, a simple process is used to transform Thermoxels' models into tetrahedral meshes compatible with FEA. We demonstrate Thermoxels' capability to generate RGB+Thermal meshes of 3D scenes, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods. To showcase the practical applications of Thermoxels' models, we conduct a simple heat conduction simulation using FEA, achieving convergence from an initial state defined by Thermoxels' thermal reconstruction. Additionally, we compare Thermoxels' image synthesis abilities with current state-of-the-art methods, showing competitive results, and discuss the limitations of existing metrics in assessing mesh quality.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04448](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04448) |

These settings are inherently ill-posed due to the lack of ground-truth data, learned geometric information, and the need to achieve accurate 3D reconstruction without finetuning, making it difficult for conventional methods to achieve high-quality results. Our model addresses these challenges by effectively integrating explicit 3D representations with self-supervised depth and pose estimation techniques, resulting in reciprocal improvements in both pose accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a matching-aware pose estimation network and a depth refinement module to enhance geometry consistency across views, ensuring more accurate and stable 3D reconstructions. To present the performance of our method, we evaluated it on large-scale real-world datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. SelfSplat achieves superior results over previous state-of-the-art methods in both appearance and geometry quality, also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization capabilities. Extensive ablation studies and analysis also validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

| 521 | 3R-GS: Best Practice in Optimizing Camera Poses Along with 3DGS | Zhisheng Huang,Peng Wang,Jingdong Zhang,Yuan Liu,Xin Li,Wenping Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized neural rendering with its efficiency and quality, but like many novel view synthesis methods, it heavily depends on accurate camera poses from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems. Although recent SfM pipelines have made impressive progress, questions remain about how to further improve both their robust performance in challenging conditions (e.g., textureless scenes) and the precision of camera parameter estimation simultaneously. We present 3R-GS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges this gap by jointly optimizing 3D Gaussians and camera parameters from large reconstruction priors MASt3R-SfM. We note that naively performing joint 3D Gaussian and camera optimization faces two challenges: the sensitivity to the quality of SfM initialization, and its limited capacity for global optimization, leading to suboptimal reconstruction results. Our 3R-GS, overcomes these issues by incorporating optimized practices, enabling robust scene reconstruction even with imperfect camera registration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3R-GS delivers high-quality novel view synthesis and precise camera pose estimation while remaining computationally efficient.

However, existing 3DGS methods pose challenges in understanding underlying 3D semantics, which hinders model controllability and interpretability. To address it, we propose an interpretable single-view 3DGS framework, termed 3DisGS, to discover both coarse- and fine-grained 3D semantics via hierarchical disentangled representation learning (DRL). Specifically, the model employs a dual-branch architecture, consisting of a point cloud initialization branch and a triplane-Gaussian generation branch, to achieve coarse-grained disentanglement by separating 3D geometry and visual appearance features. Subsequently, fine-grained semantic representations within each modality are further discovered through DRL-based encoder-adapters. To our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve unsupervised interpretable 3DGS. Evaluations indicate that our model achieves 3D disentanglement while preserving high-quality and rapid reconstruction.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04190](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04190) |
| 519 | Gaussian Scenes: Pose-Free Sparse-View Scene Reconstruction using Depth-Enhanced Diffusion Priors | Soumava Paul,Prakhar Kaushik,Alan Yuille | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this work, we introduce a generative approach for pose-free (without camera parameters) reconstruction of 360 scenes from a sparse set of 2D images. Pose-free scene reconstruction from incomplete, pose-free observations is usually regularized with depth estimation or 3D foundational priors. While recent advances have enabled sparse-view reconstruction of large complex scenes (with high degree of foreground and background detail) with known camera poses using view-conditioned generative priors, these methods cannot be directly adapted for the pose-free setting when ground-truth poses are not available during evaluation. To address this, we propose an image-to-image generative model designed to inpaint missing details and remove artifacts in novel view renders and depth maps of a 3D scene. We introduce context and geometry conditioning using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) modulation layers as a lightweight alternative to cross-attention and also propose a novel confidence measure for 3D Gaussian splat representations to allow for better detection of these artifacts. By progressively integrating these novel views in a Gaussian-SLAM-inspired process, we achieve a multi-view-consistent 3D representation. Evaluations on the MipNeRF360 and DL3DV-10K benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing pose-free techniques and performs competitively with state-of-the-art posed (precomputed camera parameters are given) reconstruction methods in complex 360 scenes.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15966](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15966) |

| 517 | Enhancing Temporal Consistency in Video Editing by Reconstructing Videos with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Inkyu Shin,Qihang Yu,Xiaohui Shen,In So Kweon,Kuk-Jin Yoon,Liang-Chieh Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in zero-shot video diffusion models have shown promise for text-driven video editing, but challenges remain in achieving high temporal consistency. To address this, we introduce Video-3DGS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based video refiner designed to enhance temporal consistency in zero-shot video editors. Our approach utilizes a two-stage 3D Gaussian optimizing process tailored for editing dynamic monocular videos. In the first stage, Video-3DGS employs an improved version of COLMAP, referred to as MC-COLMAP, which processes original videos using a Masked and Clipped approach. For each video clip, MC-COLMAP generates the point clouds for dynamic foreground objects and complex backgrounds. These point clouds are utilized to initialize two sets of 3D Gaussians (Frg-3DGS and Bkg-3DGS) aiming to represent foreground and background views. Both foreground and background views are then merged with a 2D learnable parameter map to reconstruct full views. In the second stage, we leverage the reconstruction ability developed in the first stage to impose the temporal constraints on the video diffusion model. To demonstrate the efficacy of Video-3DGS on both stages, we conduct extensive experiments across two related tasks: Video Reconstruction and Video Editing. Video-3DGS trained with 3k iterations significantly improves video reconstruction quality (+3 PSNR, +7 PSNR increase) and training efficiency (x1.9, x4.5 times faster) over NeRF-based and 3DGS-based state-of-art methods on DAVIS dataset, respectively. Moreover, it enhances video editing by ensuring temporal consistency across 58 dynamic monocular videos.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02541](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02541) |

Current approaches rely on generative models to synthesize multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction and animation. However, directly generating multiple views from a single human image suffers from geometric inconsistencies, resulting in issues like fragmented or blurred limbs in the reconstructed models. To tackle these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{HumanDreamer-X}, a novel framework that integrates multi-view human generation and reconstruction into a unified pipeline, which significantly enhances the geometric consistency and visual fidelity of the reconstructed 3D models. In this framework, 3D Gaussian Splatting serves as an explicit 3D representation to provide initial geometry and appearance priority. Building upon this foundation, \\textbf{HumanFixer} is trained to restore 3DGS renderings, which guarantee photorealistic results. Furthermore, we delve into the inherent challenges associated with attention mechanisms in multi-view human generation, and propose an attention modulation strategy that effectively enhances geometric details identity consistency across multi-view. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach markedly improves generation and reconstruction PSNR quality metrics by 16.45% and 12.65%, respectively, achieving a PSNR of up to 25.62 dB, while also showing generalization capabilities on in-the-wild data and applicability to various human reconstruction backbone models.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03536](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03536) |

However, it often struggles to capture rich details and complete geometry. Our analysis reveals that the 3D-GS densification operation lacks adaptiveness and faces a dilemma between geometry coverage and detail recovery. To address this, we introduce a novel densification operation, residual split, which adds a downscaled Gaussian as a residual. Our approach is capable of adaptively retrieving details and complementing missing geometry. To further support this method, we propose a pipeline named ResGS. Specifically, we integrate a Gaussian image pyramid for progressive supervision and implement a selection scheme that prioritizes the densification of coarse Gaussians over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering quality. Consistent performance improvements can be achieved by applying our residual split on various 3D-GS variants, underscoring its versatility and potential for broader application in 3D-GS-based applications.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07494](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07494) |

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \\& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting.

| 508 | Toward Real-world BEV Perception: Depth Uncertainty Estimation via Gaussian Splatting | Shu-Wei Lu,Yi-Hsuan Tsai,Yi-Ting Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Bird's-eye view (BEV) perception has gained significant attention because it provides a unified representation to fuse multiple view images and enables a wide range of down-stream autonomous driving tasks, such as forecasting and planning. Recent state-of-the-art models utilize projection-based methods which formulate BEV perception as query learning to bypass explicit depth estimation. While we observe promising advancements in this paradigm, they still fall short of real-world applications because of the lack of uncertainty modeling and expensive computational requirement. In this work, we introduce GaussianLSS, a novel uncertainty-aware BEV perception framework that revisits unprojection-based methods, specifically the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) paradigm, and enhances them with depth un-certainty modeling. GaussianLSS represents spatial dispersion by learning a soft depth mean and computing the variance of the depth distribution, which implicitly captures object extents. We then transform the depth distribution into 3D Gaussians and rasterize them to construct uncertainty-aware BEV features. We evaluate GaussianLSS on the nuScenes dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to unprojection-based methods. In particular, it provides significant advantages in speed, running 2.5x faster, and in memory efficiency, using 0.3x less memory compared to projection-based methods, while achieving competitive performance with only a 0.4% IoU difference.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01957](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01957) |
| 507 | ConsDreamer: Advancing Multi-View Consistency for Zero-Shot Text-to-3D Generation | Yuan Zhou,Shilong Jin,Litao Hua,Wanjun Lv,Haoran Duan,Jungong Han | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-3D generation have revolutionized 3D content creation by enabling direct synthesis from textual descriptions. While state-of-the-art methods leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting with score distillation to enhance multi-view rendering through pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, they suffer from inherent view biases in T2I priors. These biases lead to inconsistent 3D generation, particularly manifesting as the multi-face Janus problem, where objects exhibit conflicting features across views. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose ConsDreamer, a novel framework that mitigates view bias by refining both the conditional and unconditional terms in the score distillation process: (1) a View Disentanglement Module (VDM) that eliminates viewpoint biases in conditional prompts by decoupling irrelevant view components and injecting precise camera parameters; and (2) a similarity-based partial order loss that enforces geometric consistency in the unconditional term by aligning cosine similarities with azimuth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsDreamer effectively mitigates the multi-face Janus problem in text-to-3D generation, outperforming existing methods in both visual quality and consistency.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02316](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02316) |
| 506 | Distilling Multi-view Diffusion Models into 3D Generators | Hao Qin,Luyuan Chen,Ming Kong,Mengxu Lu,Qiang Zhu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce DD3G, a formulation that Distills a multi-view Diffusion model (MV-DM) into a 3D Generator using gaussian splatting. DD3G compresses and integrates extensive visual and spatial geometric knowledge from the MV-DM by simulating its ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory, ensuring the distilled generator generalizes better than those trained solely on 3D data. Unlike previous amortized optimization approaches, we align the MV-DM and 3D generator representation spaces to transfer the teacher's probabilistic flow to the student, thus avoiding inconsistencies in optimization objectives caused by probabilistic sampling. The introduction of probabilistic flow and the coupling of various attributes in 3D Gaussians introduce challenges in the generation process. To tackle this, we propose PEPD, a generator consisting of Pattern Extraction and Progressive Decoding phases, which enables efficient fusion of probabilistic flow and converts a single image into 3D Gaussians within 0.06 seconds. Furthermore, to reduce knowledge loss and overcome sparse-view supervision, we design a joint optimization objective that ensures the quality of generated samples through explicit supervision and implicit verification. Leveraging existing 2D generation models, we compile 120k high-quality RGBA images for distillation. Experiments on synthetic and public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Specifically, our approach focuses on synthesizing foreground components, such as various human instances in motion within complex scene backgrounds, from UAV perspectives. This is achieved by integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reconstructing backgrounds along with controllable synthetic human models that display diverse appearances and actions in multiple poses. To the best of our knowledge, UAVTwin is the first approach for UAV-based perception that is capable of generating high-fidelity digital twins based on 3DGS. The proposed work significantly enhances downstream models through data augmentation for real-world environments with multiple dynamic objects and significant appearance variations-both of which typically introduce artifacts in 3DGS-based modeling. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel appearance modeling strategy and a mask refinement module to enhance the training of 3D Gaussian Splatting. We demonstrate the high quality of neural rendering by achieving a 1.23 dB improvement in PSNR compared to recent methods. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of data augmentation by showing a 2.5% to 13.7% improvement in mAP for the human detection task.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02158](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02158) |
| 504 | MaskGaussian: Adaptive 3D Gaussian Representation from Probabilistic Masks | Yifei Liu,Zhihang Zhong,Yifan Zhan,Sheng Xu,Xiao Sun | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis and real-time rendering, the high memory consumption due to the use of millions of Gaussians limits its practicality. To mitigate this issue, improvements have been made by pruning unnecessary Gaussians, either through a hand-crafted criterion or by using learned masks. However, these methods deterministically remove Gaussians based on a snapshot of the pruning moment, leading to sub-optimized reconstruction performance from a long-term perspective. To address this issue, we introduce MaskGaussian, which models Gaussians as probabilistic entities rather than permanently removing them, and utilize them according to their probability of existence. To achieve this, we propose a masked-rasterization technique that enables unused yet probabilistically existing Gaussians to receive gradients, allowing for dynamic assessment of their contribution to the evolving scene and adjustment of their probability of existence. Hence, the importance of Gaussians iteratively changes and the pruned Gaussians are selected diversely. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in achieving better rendering quality with fewer Gaussians than previous pruning methods, pruning over 60% of Gaussians on average with only a 0.02 PSNR decline.

We introduce WorldPrompter, a novel generative pipeline for synthesizing traversable 3D scenes from text prompts. We leverage panoramic videos as an intermediate representation to model the 360\xc2\xb0 details of a scene. WorldPrompter incorporates a conditional 360\xc2\xb0 panoramic video generator, capable of producing a 128-frame video that simulates a person walking through and capturing a virtual environment. The resulting video is then reconstructed as Gaussian splats by a fast feedforward 3D reconstructor, enabling a true walkable experience within the 3D scene. Experiments demonstrate that our panoramic video generation model achieves convincing view consistency across frames, enabling high-quality panoramic Gaussian splat reconstruction and facilitating traversal over an area of the scene. Qualitative and quantitative results also show it outperforms the state-of-the-art 360\xc2\xb0 video generators and 3D scene generation models.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02045](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02045) |

By generating pseudo-observations conditioned on multi-view inputs, our method transforms under-constrained 3D reconstruction problems into well-posed ones, enabling robust optimization even with sparse data. GS-Diff further integrates several enhancements, including appearance embedding, monocular depth priors, dynamic object modeling, anisotropy regularization, and advanced rasterization techniques, to tackle geometric and photometric challenges in real-world settings.

Nevertheless, generating 3D scenes with multiple objects remains challenging. Therefore, we present DreamScape, a method for generating 3D scenes from text. Utilizing Gaussian Splatting for 3D representation, DreamScape introduces 3D Gaussian Guide that encodes semantic primitives, spatial transformations and relationships from text using LLMs, enabling local-to-global optimization. Progressive scale control is tailored during local object generation, addressing training instability issue arising from simple blending in the global optimization stage. Collision relationships between objects are modeled at the global level to mitigate biases in LLMs priors, ensuring physical correctness. Additionally, to generate pervasive objects like rain and snow distributed extensively across the scene, we design specialized sparse initialization and densification strategy.

However, its quality drops sharply as we depart from the training views. Thus, dense captures are needed to match the high-quality expectations of some applications, e.g. Virtual Reality (VR). However, such dense captures are very laborious and expensive to obtain. Existing works have explored using 2D generative models to alleviate this requirement by distillation or generating additional training views. These methods are often conditioned only on a handful of reference input views and thus do not fully exploit the available 3D information, leading to inconsistent generation results and reconstruction artifacts. To tackle this problem, we propose a multi-view, flow matching model that learns a flow to connect novel view renderings from possibly sparse reconstructions to renderings that we expect from dense reconstructions. This enables augmenting scene captures with novel, generated views to improve reconstruction quality. Our model is trained on a novel dataset of 3.6M image pairs and can process up to 45 views at 540x960 resolution (91K tokens) on one H100 GPU in a single forward pass. Our pipeline consistently improves NVS in sparse- and dense-view scenarios, leading to higher-quality reconstructions than prior works across multiple, widely-used NVS benchmarks.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01647](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01647) |
| 498 | 3DBonsai: Structure-Aware Bonsai Modeling Using Conditioned 3D Gaussian Splatting | Hao Wu,Hao Wang,Ruochong Li,Xuran Ma,Hui Xiong | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have shown remarkable results by leveraging 3D priors in combination with 2D diffusion. However, previous methods utilize 3D priors that lack detailed and complex structural information, limiting them to generating simple objects and presenting challenges for creating intricate structures such as bonsai. In this paper, we propose 3DBonsai, a novel text-to-3D framework for generating 3D bonsai with complex structures. Technically, we first design a trainable 3D space colonization algorithm to produce bonsai structures, which are then enhanced through random sampling and point cloud augmentation to serve as the 3D Gaussian priors. We introduce two bonsai generation pipelines with distinct structural levels: fine structure conditioned generation, which initializes 3D Gaussians using a 3D structure prior to produce detailed and complex bonsai, and coarse structure conditioned generation, which employs a multi-view structure consistency module to align 2D and 3D structures. Moreover, we have compiled a unified 2D and 3D Chinese-style bonsai dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that 3DBonsai significantly outperforms existing methods, providing a new benchmark for structure-aware 3D bonsai generation.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01619](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01619) |

However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture the dynamics of loose clothing, as they primarily rely on global pose conditioning or static per-frame representations, leading to oversmoothing and temporal inconsistencies in non-rigid regions. To address this, We propose RealityAvatar, an efficient framework for high-fidelity digital human modeling, specifically targeting loosely dressed avatars. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to capture complex clothing deformations and motion dynamics while ensuring geometric consistency. By incorporating a motion trend module and a latentbone encoder, we explicitly model pose-dependent deformations and temporal variations in clothing behavior. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing fine-grained clothing deformations and motion-driven shape variations. Our method significantly enhances structural fidelity and perceptual quality in dynamic human reconstruction, particularly in non-rigid regions, while achieving better consistency across temporal frames.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01559](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01559) |
| 496 | High-fidelity 3D Object Generation from Single Image with RGBN-Volume Gaussian Reconstruction Model | Yiyang Shen,Kun Zhou,He Wang,Yin Yang,Tianjia Shao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently single-view 3D generation via Gaussian splatting has emerged and developed quickly. They learn 3D Gaussians from 2D RGB images generated from pre-trained multi-view diffusion (MVD) models, and have shown a promising avenue for 3D generation through a single image. Despite the current progress, these methods still suffer from the inconsistency jointly caused by the geometric ambiguity in the 2D images, and the lack of structure of 3D Gaussians, leading to distorted and blurry 3D object generation. In this paper, we propose to fix these issues by GS-RGBN, a new RGBN-volume Gaussian Reconstruction Model designed to generate high-fidelity 3D objects from single-view images. Our key insight is a structured 3D representation can simultaneously mitigate the afore-mentioned two issues. To this end, we propose a novel hybrid Voxel-Gaussian representation, where a 3D voxel representation contains explicit 3D geometric information, eliminating the geometric ambiguity from 2D images. It also structures Gaussians during learning so that the optimization tends to find better local optima. Our 3D voxel representation is obtained by a fusion module that aligns RGB features and surface normal features, both of which can be estimated from 2D images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our methods over prior works in terms of high-quality reconstruction results, robust generalization, and good efficiency.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01512](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01512) |

This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-view scenarios, where variations in lighting and image signal processor (ISP) settings across viewpoints introduce photometric inconsistencies. Such lighting degradations and view-dependent variations pose substantial challenges to novel view synthesis (NVS) frameworks based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). To address this, we introduce Luminance-GS, a novel approach to achieving high-quality novel view synthesis results under diverse challenging lighting conditions using 3DGS. By adopting per-view color matrix mapping and view-adaptive curve adjustments, Luminance-GS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various lighting conditions -- including low-light, overexposure, and varying exposure -- while not altering the original 3DGS explicit representation. Compared to previous NeRF- and 3DGS-based baselines, Luminance-GS provides real-time rendering speed with improved reconstruction quality.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01503](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01503) |

Oswald,Jie Song | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting shows great potential in reconstructing photo-realistic 3D scenes. However, these methods typically bake illumination into their representations, limiting their use for physically-based rendering and scene editing. Although recent inverse rendering approaches aim to decompose scenes into material and lighting components, they often rely on simplifying assumptions that fail when editing. We present a novel approach that enables efficient global illumination for 3D Gaussians Splatting through screen-space ray tracing. Our key insight is that a substantial amount of indirect light can be traced back to surfaces visible within the current view frustum. Leveraging this observation, we augment the direct shading computed by 3D Gaussians with Monte-Carlo screen-space ray-tracing to capture one-bounce indirect illumination. In this way, our method enables realistic global illumination without sacrificing the computational efficiency and editability benefits of 3D Gaussians. Through experiments, we show that the screen-space approximation we utilize allows for indirect illumination and supports real-time rendering and editing.

| 491 | DropGaussian: Structural Regularization for Sparse-view Gaussian Splatting | Hyunwoo Park,Gun Ryu,Wonjun Kim | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has gained considerable attentions in the field of novel view synthesis due to its fast performance while yielding the excellent image quality. However, 3DGS in sparse-view settings (e.g., three-view inputs) often faces with the problem of overfitting to training views, which significantly drops the visual quality of novel view images. Many existing approaches have tackled this issue by using strong priors, such as 2D generative contextual information and external depth signals. In contrast, this paper introduces a prior-free method, so-called DropGaussian, with simple changes in 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we randomly remove Gaussians during the training process in a similar way of dropout, which allows non-excluded Gaussians to have larger gradients while improving their visibility. This makes the remaining Gaussians to contribute more to the optimization process for rendering with sparse input views. Such simple operation effectively alleviates the overfitting problem and enhances the quality of novel view synthesis. By simply applying DropGaussian to the original 3DGS framework, we can achieve the competitive performance with existing prior-based 3DGS methods in sparse-view settings of benchmark datasets without any additional complexity. The code and model are publicly available at: https://github.com/DCVL-3D/DropGaussian release.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00773](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00773) |

However, existing methods fail to perform instance-aware decomposition without manual annotations, which is crucial for instance-level scene editing.We propose UnIRe, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based approach that decomposes a scene into a static background and individual dynamic instances using only RGB images and LiDAR point clouds. At its core, we introduce 4D superpoints, a novel representation that clusters multi-frame LiDAR points in 4D space, enabling unsupervised instance separation based on spatiotemporal correlations. These 4D superpoints serve as the foundation for our decomposed 4D initialization, i.e., providing spatial and temporal initialization to train a dynamic 3DGS for arbitrary dynamic classes without requiring bounding boxes or object templates.Furthermore, we introduce a smoothness regularization strategy in both 2D and 3D space, further improving the temporal stability.Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods in decomposed dynamic scene reconstruction while enabling accurate and flexible instance-level editing, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00763) |

Compared with previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods that requires elusive multi-view datasets or tedious personalized learning/inference, MGGtalk enables more practical and broader applications. However, in the absence of multi-view and personalized training data, the incompleteness of geometric and appearance information poses a significant challenge. To address these challenges, MGGTalk explores depth information to enhance geometric and facial symmetry characteristics to supplement both geometric and appearance features. Initially, based on the pixel-wise geometric information obtained from depth estimation, we incorporate symmetry operations and point cloud filtering techniques to ensure a complete and precise position parameter for 3DGS. Subsequently, we adopt a two-stage strategy with symmetric priors for predicting the remaining 3DGS parameters. We begin by predicting Gaussian parameters for the visible facial regions of the source image. These parameters are subsequently utilized to improve the prediction of Gaussian parameters for the non-visible regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGGTalk surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance across various metrics.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00665](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00665) |

Inspired by deformable DEtection TRansformer, we design separate queries for 3D Gaussians and camera parameters and update them layer by layer through deformable Transformer layers, enabling joint optimization in a single network. This design demonstrates better performance because to accurately render views that closely approximate ground-truth images relies on precise estimation of both 3D Gaussians and camera parameters. In such a design, the centers of 3D Gaussians are projected onto each view by camera parameters to get projected points, which are regarded as 2D reference points in deformable cross-attention. With camera-aware multi-view deformable cross-attention (CaMDFA), 3D Gaussians and camera parameters are intrinsically connected by sharing the 2D reference points. Additionally, 2D reference point determined rays (RayRef) defined from camera centers to the reference points assist in modeling relationship between 3D Gaussians and camera parameters through RQ-decomposition on an overdetermined system of equations derived from the rays, enhancing the relationship between 3D Gaussians and camera parameters. Extensive evaluation shows that our approach outperforms previous methods, both pose-required and pose-free, on RealEstate10K and ACID within the same pose-free setting.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00639](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00639) |
| 487 | Robust LiDAR-Camera Calibration with 2D Gaussian Splatting | Shuyi Zhou,Shuxiang Xie,Ryoichi Ishikawa,Takeshi Oishi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>LiDAR-camera systems have become increasingly popular in robotics recently. A critical and initial step in integrating the LiDAR and camera data is the calibration of the LiDAR-camera system. Most existing calibration methods rely on auxiliary target objects, which often involve complex manual operations, whereas targetless methods have yet to achieve practical effectiveness. Recognizing that 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) can reconstruct geometric information from camera image sequences, we propose a calibration method that estimates LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameters using geometric constraints. The proposed method begins by reconstructing colorless 2DGS using LiDAR point clouds. Subsequently, we update the colors of the Gaussian splats by minimizing the photometric loss. The extrinsic parameters are optimized during this process. Additionally, we address the limitations of the photometric loss by incorporating the reprojection and triangulation losses, thereby enhancing the calibration robustness and accuracy.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00525](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00525) |
| 486 | RainyGS: Efficient Rain Synthesis with Physically-Based Gaussian Splatting | Qiyu Dai,Xingyu Ni,Qianfan Shen,Wenzheng Chen,Baoquan Chen,Mengyu Chu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We consider the problem of adding dynamic rain effects to in-the-wild scenes in a physically-correct manner. Recent advances in scene modeling have made significant progress, with NeRF and 3DGS techniques emerging as powerful tools for reconstructing complex scenes. However, while effective for novel view synthesis, these methods typically struggle with challenging scene editing tasks, such as physics-based rain simulation. In contrast, traditional physics-based simulations can generate realistic rain effects, such as raindrops and splashes, but they often rely on skilled artists to carefully set up high-fidelity scenes. This process lacks flexibility and scalability, limiting its applicability to broader, open-world environments. In this work, we introduce RainyGS, a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both physics-based modeling and 3DGS to generate photorealistic, dynamic rain effects in open-world scenes with physical accuracy. At the core of our method is the integration of physically-based raindrop and shallow water simulation techniques within the fast 3DGS rendering framework, enabling realistic and efficient simulations of raindrop behavior, splashes, and reflections. Our method supports synthesizing rain effects at over 30 fps, offering users flexible control over rain intensity -- from light drizzles to heavy downpours. We demonstrate that RainyGS performs effectively for both real-world outdoor scenes and large-scale driving scenarios, delivering more photorealistic and physically-accurate rain effects compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated high-quality results with real-time performance, it still faces challenges in indoor scenes with large, textureless regions, resulting in incomplete and noisy reconstructions due to poor point cloud initialization and underconstrained optimization. Inspired by the continuity of signed distance field (SDF), which naturally has advantages in modeling surfaces, we propose a unified optimization framework that integrates neural signed distance fields (SDFs) with 3DGS for accurate geometry reconstruction and real-time rendering. This framework incorporates a neural SDF field to guide the densification and pruning of Gaussians, enabling Gaussians to model scenes accurately even with poor initialized point clouds. Simultaneously, the geometry represented by Gaussians improves the efficiency of the SDF field by piloting its point sampling. Additionally, we introduce two regularization terms based on normal and edge priors to resolve geometric ambiguities in textureless areas and enhance detail accuracy. Extensive experiments in ScanNet and ScanNet++ show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19671](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19671) |

However, these models often struggle with generalizability across diverse environments and fail to effectively handle dynamic content. We present BTimer (short for BulletTimer), the first motion-aware feed-forward model for real-time reconstruction and novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes. Our approach reconstructs the full scene in a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation at a given target ('bullet') timestamp by aggregating information from all the context frames. Such a formulation allows BTimer to gain scalability and generalization by leveraging both static and dynamic scene datasets. Given a casual monocular dynamic video, BTimer reconstructs a bullet-time scene within 150ms while reaching state-of-the-art performance on both static and dynamic scene datasets, even compared with optimization-based approaches.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03526](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03526) |

The proposed method enables high-quality rendering from single-view input. Unlike prior Gaussian Splatting methods that primarily focus on geometry refinement, we emphasize the importance of joint optimization of image and depth features for accurate Gaussian prediction. To this end, we first incorporate sparse LiDAR depth as an additional input modality, formulating the Gaussian prediction process as a joint learning framework of visual information and geometric clue. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal feature matching strategy coupled with a multi-scale Gaussian decoding model to enhance the joint refinement of multi-modal features, thereby enabling efficient multi-modal Gaussian learning. Extensive experiments on two large-scale autonomous driving datasets, Waymo and KITTI, demonstrate that our ADGaussian achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization capabilities in novel-view shifting.</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00437](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00437) |
| 482 | Scene4U: Hierarchical Layered 3D Scene Reconstruction from Single Panoramic Image for Your Immerse Exploration | Zilong Huang,Jun He,Junyan Ye,Lihan Jiang,Weijia Li,Yiping Chen,Ting Han | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The reconstruction of immersive and realistic 3D scenes holds significant practical importance in various fields of computer vision and computer graphics. Typically, immersive and realistic scenes should be free from obstructions by dynamic objects, maintain global texture consistency, and allow for unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven scene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a moving virtual camera to generate the scene. However, previous methods struggle with visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying camera poses, and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by foreground-background occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel layered 3D scene reconstruction framework from panoramic image, named Scene4U. Specifically, Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a large language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then, we employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded regions using visual cues and depth information, generating a hierarchical representation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation, followed by layered optimization, which ultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural consistency that supports free exploration. Scene4U outperforms state-of-the-art method, improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE, while also achieving the fastest training speed. Additionally, to demonstrate the robustness of Scene4U and allow users to experience immersive scenes from various landmarks, we build WorldVista3D dataset for 3D scene reconstruction, which contains panoramic images of globally renowned sites. The implementation code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/Scene4U .</details> | April 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00387](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00387) |

Inspired by this intuition, we propose Visual Acoustic Fields, a framework that bridges hitting sounds and visual signals within a 3D space using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach features two key modules: sound generation and sound localization. The sound generation module leverages a conditional diffusion model, which takes multiscale features rendered from a feature-augmented 3DGS to generate realistic hitting sounds. Meanwhile, the sound localization module enables querying the 3D scene, represented by the feature-augmented 3DGS, to localize hitting positions based on the sound sources. To support this framework, we introduce a novel pipeline for collecting scene-level visual-sound sample pairs, achieving alignment between captured images, impact locations, and corresponding sounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to connect visual and acoustic signals in a 3D context. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Visual Acoustic Fields in generating plausible impact sounds and accurately localizing impact sources.

While LangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations, achieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes, it lacks the ability to handle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP, designed for static image-text tasks, cannot capture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently dynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D language field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video features, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these challenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision features and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video captions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text prompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent, high-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are encoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings, which then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision, facilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces. Recognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states, we further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous changes over time effectively. Our results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that 4D LangSplat attains precise and efficient results for both time-sensitive and time-agnostic open-vocabulary queries.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10437](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10437) |

We present a fully automated Real2Sim pipeline that generates simulation-ready assets for real-world objects through robotic interaction. Using only a robot's joint torque sensors and an external camera, the pipeline identifies visual geometry, collision geometry, and physical properties such as inertial parameters. Our approach introduces a general method for extracting high-quality, object-centric meshes from photometric reconstruction techniques (e.g., NeRF, Gaussian Splatting) by employing alpha-transparent training while explicitly distinguishing foreground occlusions from background subtraction. We validate the full pipeline through extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse objects. By eliminating the need for manual intervention or environment modifications, our pipeline can be integrated directly into existing pick-and-place setups, enabling scalable and efficient dataset creation.

| 478 | LITA-GS: Illumination-Agnostic Novel View Synthesis via Reference-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting and Physical Priors | Han Zhou,Wei Dong,Jun Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Directly employing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) on images with adverse illumination conditions exhibits considerable difficulty in achieving high-quality, normally-exposed representations due to: (1) The limited Structure from Motion (SfM) points estimated in adverse illumination scenarios fail to capture sufficient scene details; (2) Without ground-truth references, the intensive information loss, significant noise, and color distortion pose substantial challenges for 3DGS to produce high-quality results; (3) Combining existing exposure correction methods with 3DGS does not achieve satisfactory performance due to their individual enhancement processes, which lead to the illumination inconsistency between enhanced images from different viewpoints. To address these issues, we propose LITA-GS, a novel illumination-agnostic novel view synthesis method via reference-free 3DGS and physical priors. Firstly, we introduce an illumination-invariant physical prior extraction pipeline. Secondly, based on the extracted robust spatial structure prior, we develop the lighting-agnostic structure rendering strategy, which facilitates the optimization of the scene structure and object appearance. Moreover, a progressive denoising module is introduced to effectively mitigate the noise within the light-invariant representation. We adopt the unsupervised strategy for the training of LITA-GS and extensive experiments demonstrate that LITA-GS surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) NeRF-based method while enjoying faster inference speed and costing reduced training time.

| 477 | Self-Calibrating 4D Novel View Synthesis from Monocular Videos Using Gaussian Splatting | Fang Li,Hao Zhang,Narendra Ahuja | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian Splatting (GS) has significantly elevated scene reconstruction efficiency and novel view synthesis (NVS) accuracy compared to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), particularly for dynamic scenes. However, current 4D NVS methods, whether based on GS or NeRF, primarily rely on camera parameters provided by COLMAP and even utilize sparse point clouds generated by COLMAP for initialization, which lack accuracy as well are time-consuming. This sometimes results in poor dynamic scene representation, especially in scenes with large object movements, or extreme camera conditions e.g. small translations combined with large rotations. Some studies simultaneously optimize the estimation of camera parameters and scenes, supervised by additional information like depth, optical flow, etc. obtained from off-the-shelf models. Using this unverified information as ground truth can reduce robustness and accuracy, which does frequently occur for long monocular videos (with e.g. > hundreds of frames). We propose a novel approach that learns a high-fidelity 4D GS scene representation with self-calibration of camera parameters. It includes the extraction of 2D point features that robustly represent 3D structure, and their use for subsequent joint optimization of camera parameters and 3D structure towards overall 4D scene optimization. We demonstrate the accuracy and time efficiency of our method through extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results on several standard benchmarks. The results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for 4D novel view synthesis.

| 475 | Free360: Layered Gaussian Splatting for Unbounded 360-Degree View Synthesis from Extremely Sparse and Unposed Views | Chong Bao,Xiyu Zhang,Zehao Yu,Jiale Shi,Guofeng Zhang,Songyou Peng,Zhaopeng Cui | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Neural rendering has demonstrated remarkable success in high-quality 3D neural reconstruction and novel view synthesis with dense input views and accurate poses. However, applying it to extremely sparse, unposed views in unbounded 360\xc2\xb0 scenes remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel neural rendering framework to accomplish the unposed and extremely sparse-view 3D reconstruction in unbounded 360\xc2\xb0 scenes. To resolve the spatial ambiguity inherent in unbounded scenes with sparse input views, we propose a layered Gaussian-based representation to effectively model the scene with distinct spatial layers. By employing a dense stereo reconstruction model to recover coarse geometry, we introduce a layer-specific bootstrap optimization to refine the noise and fill occluded regions in the reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose an iterative fusion of reconstruction and generation alongside an uncertainty-aware training approach to facilitate mutual conditioning and enhancement between these two processes. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of rendering quality and surface reconstruction accuracy.

Cuntoor | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This work addresses the problem of novel view synthesis in diverse scenes from small collections of RGB images. We propose ERUPT (Efficient Rendering with Unposed Patch Transformer) a state-of-the-art scene reconstruction model capable of efficient scene rendering using unposed imagery. We introduce patch-based querying, in contrast to existing pixel-based queries, to reduce the compute required to render a target view. This makes our model highly efficient both during training and at inference, capable of rendering at 600 fps on commercial hardware. Notably, our model is designed to use a learned latent camera pose which allows for training using unposed targets in datasets with sparse or inaccurate ground truth camera pose. We show that our approach can generalize on large real-world data and introduce a new benchmark dataset (MSVS-1M) for latent view synthesis using street-view imagery collected from Mapillary. In contrast to NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, which require dense imagery and precise metadata, ERUPT can render novel views of arbitrary scenes with as few as five unposed input images. ERUPT achieves better rendered image quality than current state-of-the-art methods for unposed image synthesis tasks, reduces labeled data requirements by ~95\\% and decreases computational requirements by an order of magnitude, providing efficient novel view synthesis for diverse real-world scenes.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24374](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24374) |
| 473 | StochasticSplats: Stochastic Rasterization for Sorting-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting | Shakiba Kheradmand,Delio Vicini,George Kopanas,Dmitry Lagun,Kwang Moo Yi,Mark Matthews,Andrea Tagliasacchi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a popular radiance field method, with many application-specific extensions. Most variants rely on the same core algorithm: depth-sorting of Gaussian splats then rasterizing in primitive order. This ensures correct alpha compositing, but can cause rendering artifacts due to built-in approximations. Moreover, for a fixed representation, sorted rendering offers little control over render cost and visual fidelity. For example, and counter-intuitively, rendering a lower-resolution image is not necessarily faster. In this work, we address the above limitations by combining 3D Gaussian splatting with stochastic rasterization. Concretely, we leverage an unbiased Monte Carlo estimator of the volume rendering equation. This removes the need for sorting, and allows for accurate 3D blending of overlapping Gaussians. The number of Monte Carlo samples further imbues 3DGS with a way to trade off computation time and quality. We implement our method using OpenGL shaders, enabling efficient rendering on modern GPU hardware. At a reasonable visual quality, our method renders more than four times faster than sorted rasterization.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24366](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24366) |
| 472 | DiET-GS: Diffusion Prior and Event Stream-Assisted Motion Deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting | Seungjun Lee,Gim Hee Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing sharp 3D representations from blurry multi-view images are long-standing problem in computer vision. Recent works attempt to enhance high-quality novel view synthesis from the motion blur by leveraging event-based cameras, benefiting from high dynamic range and microsecond temporal resolution. However, they often reach sub-optimal visual quality in either restoring inaccurate color or losing fine-grained details. In this paper, we present DiET-GS, a diffusion prior and event stream-assisted motion deblurring 3DGS. Our framework effectively leverages both blur-free event streams and diffusion prior in a two-stage training strategy. Specifically, we introduce the novel framework to constraint 3DGS with event double integral, achieving both accurate color and well-defined details. Additionally, we propose a simple technique to leverage diffusion prior to further enhance the edge details. Qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our DiET-GS is capable of producing significantly better quality of novel views compared to the existing baselines.

It encodes images into a 3D Gaussian particle representation, propagates dynamics via a transformer, and renders frames using 3D Gaussian splatting. By jointly training inverse rendering with a dynamics transformer using a temporal encoding and merging layer, 3DGSimembeds physical properties into point-wise latent vectors without enforcing explicit connectivity constraints.

| 470 | ExScene: Free-View 3D Scene Reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting from a Single Image | Tianyi Gong,Boyan Li,Yifei Zhong,Fangxin Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The increasing demand for augmented and virtual reality applications has highlighted the importance of crafting immersive 3D scenes from a simple single-view image. However, due to the partial priors provided by single-view input, existing methods are often limited to reconstruct low-consistency 3D scenes with narrow fields of view from single-view input. These limitations make them less capable of generalizing to reconstruct immersive scenes. To address this problem, we propose ExScene, a two-stage pipeline to reconstruct an immersive 3D scene from any given single-view image. ExScene designs a novel multimodal diffusion model to generate a high-fidelity and globally consistent panoramic image. We then develop a panoramic depth estimation approach to calculate geometric information from panorama, and we combine geometric information with high-fidelity panoramic image to train an initial 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. Following this, we introduce a GS refinement technique with 2D stable video diffusion priors. We add camera trajectory consistency and color-geometric priors into the denoising process of diffusion to improve color and spatial consistency across image sequences. These refined sequences are then used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model, leading to better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our ExScene achieves consistent and immersive scene reconstruction using only single-view input, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23881](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23881) |
| 469 | Gaussian Eigen Models for Human Heads | Wojciech Zielonka,Timo Bolkart,Thabo Beeler,Justus Thies | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Current personalized neural head avatars face a trade-off: lightweight models lack detail and realism, while high-quality, animatable avatars require significant computational resources, making them unsuitable for commodity devices. To address this gap, we introduce Gaussian Eigen Models (GEM), which provide high-quality, lightweight, and easily controllable head avatars. GEM utilizes 3D Gaussian primitives for representing the appearance combined with Gaussian splatting for rendering. Building on the success of mesh-based 3D morphable face models (3DMM), we define GEM as an ensemble of linear eigenbases for representing the head appearance of a specific subject. In particular, we construct linear bases to represent the position, scale, rotation, and opacity of the 3D Gaussians. This allows us to efficiently generate Gaussian primitives of a specific head shape by a linear combination of the basis vectors, only requiring a low-dimensional parameter vector that contains the respective coefficients. We propose to construct these linear bases (GEM) by distilling high-quality compute-intense CNN-based Gaussian avatar models that can generate expression-dependent appearance changes like wrinkles. These high-quality models are trained on multi-view videos of a subject and are distilled using a series of principal component analyses. Once we have obtained the bases that represent the animatable appearance space of a specific human, we learn a regressor that takes a single RGB image as input and predicts the low-dimensional parameter vector that corresponds to the shown facial expression. In a series of experiments, we compare GEM's self-reenactment and cross-person reenactment results to state-of-the-art 3D avatar methods, demonstrating GEM's higher visual quality and better generalization to new expressions.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04545](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04545) |

Garbin,Alexandros Lattas,George Kopanas,Paulo Gotardo,Thabo Beeler,Justus Thies,Timo Bolkart | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present SynShot, a novel method for the few-shot inversion of a drivable head avatar based on a synthetic prior. We tackle three major challenges. First, training a controllable 3D generative network requires a large number of diverse sequences, for which pairs of images and high-quality tracked meshes are not always available. Second, the use of real data is strictly regulated (e.g., under the General Data Protection Regulation, which mandates frequent deletion of models and data to accommodate a situation when a participant's consent is withdrawn). Synthetic data, free from these constraints, is an appealing alternative. Third, state-of-the-art monocular avatar models struggle to generalize to new views and expressions, lacking a strong prior and often overfitting to a specific viewpoint distribution. Inspired by machine learning models trained solely on synthetic data, we propose a method that learns a prior model from a large dataset of synthetic heads with diverse identities, expressions, and viewpoints. With few input images, SynShot fine-tunes the pretrained synthetic prior to bridge the domain gap, modeling a photorealistic head avatar that generalizes to novel expressions and viewpoints. We model the head avatar using 3D Gaussian splatting and a convolutional encoder-decoder that outputs Gaussian parameters in UV texture space. To account for the different modeling complexities over parts of the head (e.g., skin vs hair), we embed the prior with explicit control for upsampling the number of per-part primitives. Compared to SOTA monocular and GAN-based methods, SynShot significantly improves novel view and expression synthesis.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06903](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06903) |

In this paper, we introduce a robust watermarking method for 3D-GS that secures copyright of both the model and its rendered images. Our proposed method remains robust against distortions in rendered images and model attacks while maintaining high rendering quality. To achieve these objectives, we present Frequency-Guided Densification (FGD), which removes 3D Gaussians based on their contribution to rendering quality, enhancing real-time rendering and the robustness of the message. FGD utilizes Discrete Fourier Transform to split 3D Gaussians in high-frequency areas, improving rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ a gradient mask for 3D Gaussians and design a wavelet-subband loss to enhance rendering quality. Our experiments show that our method embeds the message in the rendered images invisibly and robustly against various attacks, including model distortion. Our method achieves superior performance in both rendering quality and watermark robustness while improving real-time rendering efficiency.

While Radiance Field-based methods achieve state-of-the-art quality in challenging scenarios such as in-the-wild captures and large-scale scenes, they often suffer from excessively high compute requirements linked to volumetric rendering. Gaussian Splatting-based methods, on the other hand, rely on rasterization and naturally achieve real-time rendering but suffer from brittle optimization heuristics that underperform on more challenging scenes. In this work, we present RadSplat, a lightweight method for robust real-time rendering of complex scenes. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we use radiance fields as a prior and supervision signal for optimizing point-based scene representations, leading to improved quality and more robust optimization. Next, we develop a novel pruning technique reducing the overall point count while maintaining high quality, leading to smaller and more compact scene representations with faster inference speeds. Finally, we propose a novel test-time filtering approach that further accelerates rendering and allows to scale to larger, house-sized scenes. We find that our method enables state-of-the-art synthesis of complex captures at 900+ FPS.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13806](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13806) |
| 465 | Drag Your Gaussian: Effective Drag-Based Editing with Score Distillation for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Yansong Qu,Dian Chen,Xinyang Li,Xiaofan Li,Shengchuan Zhang,Liujuan Cao,Rongrong Ji | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in 3D scene editing have been propelled by the rapid development of generative models. Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

| 464 | Disentangled 4D Gaussian Splatting: Towards Faster and More Efficient Dynamic Scene Rendering | Hao Feng,Hao Sun,Wei Xie | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel-view synthesis (NVS) for dynamic scenes from 2D images presents significant challenges due to the spatial complexity and temporal variability of such scenes. Recently, inspired by the remarkable success of NVS using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), researchers have sought to extend 3D Gaussian models to four dimensions (4D) for dynamic novel-view synthesis. However, methods based on 4D rotation and scaling introduce spatiotemporal deformation into the 4D covariance matrix, necessitating the slicing of 4D Gaussians into 3D Gaussians. This process increases redundant computations as timestamps change-an inherent characteristic of dynamic scene rendering. Additionally, performing calculations on a four-dimensional matrix is computationally intensive. In this paper, we introduce Disentangled 4D Gaussian Splatting (Disentangled4DGS), a novel representation and rendering approach that disentangles temporal and spatial deformations, thereby eliminating the reliance on 4D matrix computations. We extend the 3DGS rendering process to 4D, enabling the projection of temporal and spatial deformations into dynamic 2D Gaussians in ray space. Consequently, our method facilitates faster dynamic scene synthesis. Moreover, it reduces storage requirements by at least 4.5\\% due to our efficient presentation method. Our approach achieves an unprecedented average rendering speed of 343 FPS at a resolution of $1352\\times1014$ on an RTX 3090 GPU, with experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrating its competitive performance in both monocular and multi-view scenarios.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22159](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22159) |

However, despite its effectiveness on high-end GPUs, it struggles on edge systems like the Jetson Orin NX Edge GPU, achieving only 7-17 FPS -- well below the over 60 FPS standard required for truly immersive AR/VR experiences. Addressing this challenge, we perform a comprehensive analysis of Gaussian-based AR/VR applications and identify the Gaussian Blending Stage, which intensively calculates each Gaussian's contribution at every pixel, as the primary bottleneck. In response, we propose a Gaussian Blending Unit (GBU), an edge GPU plug-in module for real-time rendering in AR/VR applications. Notably, our GBU can be seamlessly integrated into conventional edge GPUs and collaboratively supports a wide range of AR/VR applications. Specifically, GBU incorporates an intra-row sequential shading (IRSS) dataflow that shades each row of pixels sequentially from left to right, utilizing a two-step coordinate transformation. When directly deployed on a GPU, the proposed dataflow achieved a non-trivial 1.72x speedup on real-world static scenes, though still falls short of real-time rendering performance. Recognizing the limited compute utilization in the GPU-based implementation, GBU enhances rendering speed with a dedicated rendering engine that balances the workload across rows by aggregating computations from multiple Gaussians. Experiments across representative AR/VR applications demonstrate that our GBU provides a unified solution for on-device real-time rendering while maintaining SOTA rendering quality.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23625](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23625) |
| 462 | Enhancing 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression via Spatial Condition-based Prediction | Jingui Ma,Yang Hu,Luyang Tang,Jiayu Yang,Yongqi Zhai,Ronggang Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian Spatting (3DGS) has gained widespread attention in Novel View Synthesis (NVS) due to the remarkable real-time rendering performance. However, the substantial cost of storage and transmission of vanilla 3DGS hinders its further application (hundreds of megabytes or even gigabytes for a single scene). Motivated by the achievements of prediction in video compression, we introduce the prediction technique into the anchor-based Gaussian representation to effectively reduce the bit rate. Specifically, we propose a spatial condition-based prediction module to utilize the grid-captured scene information for prediction, with a residual compensation strategy designed to learn the missing fine-grained information. Besides, to further compress the residual, we propose an instance-aware hyper prior, developing a structure-aware and instance-aware entropy model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our prediction-based compression framework and each technical component. Even compared with SOTA compression method, our framework still achieves a bit rate savings of 24.42 percent.

This ability is crucial for tasks such as vision-language navigation and autonomous robotics. However, current methods struggle because they rely heavily on fine-tuning with 3D annotations and mask proposals, which limits their ability to handle diverse semantics and common knowledge required for effective reasoning. In this work, we propose ReasonGrounder, an LVLM-guided framework that uses hierarchical 3D feature Gaussian fields for adaptive grouping based on physical scale, enabling open-vocabulary 3D grounding and reasoning. ReasonGrounder interprets implicit instructions using large vision-language models (LVLM) and localizes occluded objects through 3D Gaussian splatting. By incorporating 2D segmentation masks from the SAM and multi-view CLIP embeddings, ReasonGrounder selects Gaussian groups based on object scale, enabling accurate localization through both explicit and implicit language understanding, even in novel, occluded views. We also contribute ReasoningGD, a new dataset containing over 10K scenes and 2 million annotations for evaluating open-vocabulary 3D grounding and amodal perception under occlusion. Experiments show that ReasonGrounder significantly improves 3D grounding accuracy in real-world scenarios.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23297](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23297) |
| 460 | NeuralGS: Bridging Neural Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting for Compact 3D Representations | Zhenyu Tang,Chaoran Feng,Xinhua Cheng,Wangbo Yu,Junwu Zhang,Yuan Liu,Xiaoxiao Long,Wenping Wang,Li Yuan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) demonstrates superior quality and rendering speed, but with millions of 3D Gaussians and significant storage and transmission costs. Recent 3DGS compression methods mainly concentrate on compressing Scaffold-GS, achieving impressive performance but with an additional voxel structure and a complex encoding and quantization strategy. In this paper, we aim to develop a simple yet effective method called NeuralGS that explores in another way to compress the original 3DGS into a compact representation without the voxel structure and complex quantization strategies. Our observation is that neural fields like NeRF can represent complex 3D scenes with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using only a few megabytes. Thus, NeuralGS effectively adopts the neural field representation to encode the attributes of 3D Gaussians with MLPs, only requiring a small storage size even for a large-scale scene. To achieve this, we adopt a clustering strategy and fit the Gaussians with different tiny MLPs for each cluster, based on importance scores of Gaussians as fitting weights. We experiment on multiple datasets, achieving a 45-times average model size reduction without harming the visual quality. The compression performance of our method on original 3DGS is comparable to the dedicated Scaffold-GS-based compression methods, which demonstrate the huge potential of directly compressing original 3DGS with neural fields.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23162](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23162) |

These core issues arise from its inherently unstructured design and the absence of efficient parallelization. To overcome these challenges simultaneously, we introduce CityGS-X, a scalable architecture built on a novel parallelized hybrid hierarchical 3D representation (PH^2-3D). As an early attempt, CityGS-X abandons the cumbersome merge-and-partition process and instead adopts a newly-designed batch-level multi-task rendering process. This architecture enables efficient multi-GPU rendering through dynamic Level-of-Detail voxel allocations, significantly improving scalability and performance. Through extensive experiments, CityGS-X consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of faster training times, larger rendering capacities, and more accurate geometric details in large-scale scenes. Notably, CityGS-X can train and render a scene with 5,000+ images in just 5 hours using only 4 * 4090 GPUs, a task that would make other alternative methods encounter Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issues and fail completely. This implies that CityGS-X is far beyond the capacity of other existing methods.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23044](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23044) |
| 458 | FreeSplat++: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting for Efficient Indoor Scene Reconstruction | Yunsong Wang,Tianxin Huang,Hanlin Chen,Gim Hee Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, the integration of the efficient feed-forward scheme into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has been actively explored. However, most existing methods focus on sparse view reconstruction of small regions and cannot produce eligible whole-scene reconstruction results in terms of either quality or efficiency. In this paper, we propose FreeSplat++, which focuses on extending the generalizable 3DGS to become an alternative approach to large-scale indoor whole-scene reconstruction, which has the potential of significantly accelerating the reconstruction speed and improving the geometric accuracy. To facilitate whole-scene reconstruction, we initially propose the Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation framework to efficiently process extremely long input sequences. Subsequently, we introduce a carefully designed pixel-wise triplet fusion method to incrementally aggregate the overlapping 3D Gaussian primitives from multiple views, adaptively reducing their redundancy. Furthermore, we propose a weighted floater removal strategy that can effectively reduce floaters, which serves as an explicit depth fusion approach that is crucial in whole-scene reconstruction. After the feed-forward reconstruction of 3DGS primitives, we investigate a depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning process. Leveraging the dense, multi-view consistent depth maps obtained during the feed-forward prediction phase for an extra constraint, we refine the entire scene's 3DGS primitive to enhance rendering quality while preserving geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments confirm that our FreeSplat++ significantly outperforms existing generalizable 3DGS methods, especially in whole-scene reconstructions. Compared to conventional per-scene optimized 3DGS approaches, our method with depth-regularized per-scene fine-tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in reconstruction accuracy and a notable reduction in training time.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22986](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22986) |
| 457 | TranSplat: Lighting-Consistent Cross-Scene Object Transfer with 3D Gaussian Splatting |  Boyang, Yu,Yanlin Jin,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Akshat Dave,Guha Balakrishnan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present TranSplat, a 3D scene rendering algorithm that enables realistic cross-scene object transfer (from a source to a target scene) based on the Gaussian Splatting framework. Our approach addresses two critical challenges: (1) precise 3D object extraction from the source scene, and (2) faithful relighting of the transferred object in the target scene without explicit material property estimation. TranSplat fits a splatting model to the source scene, using 2D object masks to drive fine-grained 3D segmentation. Following user-guided insertion of the object into the target scene, along with automatic refinement of position and orientation, TranSplat derives per-Gaussian radiance transfer functions via spherical harmonic analysis to adapt the object's appearance to match the target scene's lighting environment. This relighting strategy does not require explicitly estimating physical scene properties such as BRDFs. Evaluated on several synthetic and real-world scenes and objects, TranSplat yields excellent 3D object extractions and relighting performance compared to recent baseline methods and visually convincing cross-scene object transfers. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the approach.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22676](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22676) |
| 456 | Audio-Plane: Audio Factorization Plane Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Talking Head Synthesis | Shuai Shen,Wanhua Li,Yunpeng Zhang,Weipeng Hu,Yap-Peng Tan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Talking head synthesis has become a key research area in computer graphics and multimedia, yet most existing methods often struggle to balance generation quality with computational efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages an Audio Factorization Plane (Audio-Plane) based Gaussian Splatting for high-quality and real-time talking head generation. For modeling a dynamic talking head, 4D volume representation is needed. However, directly storing a dense 4D grid is impractical due to the high cost and lack of scalability for longer durations. We overcome this challenge with the proposed Audio-Plane, where the 4D volume representation is decomposed into audio-independent space planes and audio-dependent planes. This provides a compact and interpretable feature representation for talking head, facilitating more precise audio-aware spatial encoding and enhanced audio-driven lip dynamic modeling. To further improve speech dynamics, we develop a dynamic splatting method that helps the network more effectively focus on modeling the dynamics of the mouth region. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating these innovations with the powerful Gaussian Splatting, our method is capable of synthesizing highly realistic talking videos in real time while ensuring precise audio-lip synchronization. Synthesized results are available in https://sstzal.github.io/Audio-Plane/.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22605](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22605) |

Mazomenos | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Complete reconstruction of surgical scenes is crucial for robot-assisted surgery (RAS). Deep depth estimation is promising but existing works struggle with depth discontinuities, resulting in noisy predictions at object boundaries and do not achieve complete reconstruction omitting occluded surfaces. To address these issues we propose EndoLRMGS, that combines Large Reconstruction Modelling (LRM) and Gaussian Splatting (GS), for complete surgical scene reconstruction. GS reconstructs deformable tissues and LRM generates 3D models for surgical tools while position and scale are subsequently optimized by introducing orthogonal perspective joint projection optimization (OPjPO) to enhance accuracy. In experiments on four surgical videos from three public datasets, our method improves the Intersection-over-union (IoU) of tool 3D models in 2D projections by>40%. Additionally, EndoLRMGS improves the PSNR of the tools projection from 3.82% to 11.07%. Tissue rendering quality also improves, with PSNR increasing from 0.46% to 49.87%, and SSIM from 1.53% to 29.21% across all test videos.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22437](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22437) |
| 454 | GaussianUDF: Inferring Unsigned Distance Functions through 3D Gaussian Splatting | Shujuan Li,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing open surfaces from multi-view images is vital in digitalizing complex objects in daily life. A widely used strategy is to learn unsigned distance functions (UDFs) by checking if their appearance conforms to the image observations through neural rendering. However, it is still hard to learn continuous and implicit UDF representations through 3D Gaussians splatting (3DGS) due to the discrete and explicit scene representation, i.e., 3D Gaussians. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel approach to bridge the gap between 3D Gaussians and UDFs. Our key idea is to overfit thin and flat 2D Gaussian planes on surfaces, and then, leverage the self-supervision and gradient-based inference to supervise unsigned distances in both near and far area to surfaces. To this end, we introduce novel constraints and strategies to constrain the learning of 2D Gaussians to pursue more stable optimization and more reliable self-supervision, addressing the challenges brought by complicated gradient field on or near the zero level set of UDFs. We report numerical and visual comparisons with the state-of-the-art on widely used benchmarks and real data to show our advantages in terms of accuracy, efficiency, completeness, and sharpness of reconstructed open surfaces with boundaries.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19458](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19458) |
| 453 | AH-GS: Augmented 3D Gaussian Splatting for High-Frequency Detail Representation | Chenyang Xu,XingGuo Deng,Rui Zhong | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) is a novel method for scene representation and view synthesis. Although Scaffold-GS achieves higher quality real-time rendering compared to the original 3D-GS, its fine-grained rendering of the scene is extremely dependent on adequate viewing angles. The spectral bias of neural network learning results in Scaffold-GS's poor ability to perceive and learn high-frequency information in the scene. In this work, we propose enhancing the manifold complexity of input features and using network-based feature map loss to improve the image reconstruction quality of 3D-GS models. We introduce AH-GS, which enables 3D Gaussians in structurally complex regions to obtain higher-frequency encodings, allowing the model to more effectively learn the high-frequency information of the scene. Additionally, we incorporate high-frequency reinforce loss to further enhance the model's ability to capture detailed frequency information. Our result demonstrates that our model significantly improves rendering fidelity, and in specific scenarios (e.g., MipNeRf360-garden), our method exceeds the rendering quality of Scaffold-GS in just 15K iterations.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22324](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22324) |
| 452 | Follow Your Motion: A Generic Temporal Consistency Portrait Editing Framework with Trajectory Guidance | Haijie Yang,Zhenyu Zhang,Hao Tang,Jianjun Qian,Jian Yang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Pre-trained conditional diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential in image editing. However, they often face challenges with temporal consistency, particularly in the talking head domain, where continuous changes in facial expressions intensify the level of difficulty. These issues stem from the independent editing of individual images and the inherent loss of temporal continuity during the editing process. In this paper, we introduce Follow Your Motion (FYM), a generic framework for maintaining temporal consistency in portrait editing. Specifically, given portrait images rendered by a pre-trained 3D Gaussian Splatting model, we first develop a diffusion model that intuitively and inherently learns motion trajectory changes at different scales and pixel coordinates, from the first frame to each subsequent frame. This approach ensures that temporally inconsistent edited avatars inherit the motion information from the rendered avatars. Secondly, to maintain fine-grained expression temporal consistency in talking head editing, we propose a dynamic re-weighted attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns higher weight coefficients to landmark points in space and dynamically updates these weights based on landmark loss, achieving more consistent and refined facial expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of temporal consistency and can be used to optimize and compensate for temporally inconsistent outputs in a range of applications, such as text-driven editing, relighting, and various other applications.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22225](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22225) |

However, NNFM loss does not consider global style information. In addition, the implicit representation of NeRF limits their fine-grained control over the resulting scenes. In this paper, we introduce ABC-GS, a novel framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve high-quality 3D style transfer. To this end, a controllable matching stage is designed to achieve precise alignment between scene content and style features through segmentation masks. Moreover, a style transfer loss function based on feature alignment is proposed to ensure that the outcomes of style transfer accurately reflect the global style of the reference image. Furthermore, the original geometric information of the scene is preserved with the depth loss and Gaussian regularization terms. Extensive experiments show that our ABC-GS provides controllability of style transfer and achieves stylization results that are more faithfully aligned with the global style of the chosen artistic reference.

| 450 | Segment then Splat: A Unified Approach for 3D Open-Vocabulary Segmentation based on Gaussian Splatting | Yiren Lu,Yunlai Zhou,Yiran Qiao,Chaoda Song,Tuo Liang,Jing Ma,Yu Yin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Open-vocabulary querying in 3D space is crucial for enabling more intelligent perception in applications such as robotics, autonomous systems, and augmented reality. However, most existing methods rely on 2D pixel-level parsing, leading to multi-view inconsistencies and poor 3D object retrieval. Moreover, they are limited to static scenes and struggle with dynamic scenes due to the complexities of motion modeling. In this paper, we propose Segment then Splat, a 3D-aware open vocabulary segmentation approach for both static and dynamic scenes based on Gaussian Splatting. Segment then Splat reverses the long established approach of "segmentation after reconstruction" by dividing Gaussians into distinct object sets before reconstruction. Once the reconstruction is complete, the scene is naturally segmented into individual objects, achieving true 3D segmentation. This approach not only eliminates Gaussian-object misalignment issues in dynamic scenes but also accelerates the optimization process, as it eliminates the need for learning a separate language field. After optimization, a CLIP embedding is assigned to each object to enable open-vocabulary querying. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in both static and dynamic scenarios.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22204](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22204) |

However, extending these achievements to enable free-form interactions and high-level semantic operations with complex 3D/4D scenes remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the limited availability of large-scale, annotated 3D/4D or multi-view datasets, which are crucial for generalizable vision and language tasks such as open-vocabulary and prompt-based segmentation, language-guided editing, and visual question answering (VQA). In this paper, we introduce Feature4X, a universal framework designed to extend any functionality from 2D vision foundation model into the 4D realm, using only monocular video input, which is widely available from user-generated content. The "X" in Feature4X represents its versatility, enabling any task through adaptable, model-conditioned 4D feature field distillation. At the core of our framework is a dynamic optimization strategy that unifies multiple model capabilities into a single representation. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, Feature4X is the first method to distill and lift the features of video foundation models (e.g., SAM2, InternVideo2) into an explicit 4D feature field using Gaussian Splatting. Our experiments showcase novel view segment anything, geometric and appearance scene editing, and free-form VQA across all time steps, empowered by LLMs in feedback loops.

We leverage the geometry field proposed in recent work for stochastic opaque surfaces, which can then be converted to volume densities. We adapt Gaussian kernels or surfels to splat the geometry field rather than the volume, enabling precise reconstruction of opaque solids. Our first contribution is to derive an efficient and almost exact differentiable rendering algorithm for geometry fields parameterized by Gaussian surfels, while removing current approximations involving Taylor series and no self-attenuation. Next, we address the discontinuous loss landscape when surfels cluster near geometry, showing how to guarantee that the rendered color is a continuous function of the colors of the kernels, irrespective of ordering. Finally, we use latent representations with spherical harmonics encoded reflection vectors rather than spherical harmonics encoded colors to better address specular surfaces.

Departing from this, we introduce DOF-GS--a new 3DGS-based framework with a finite-aperture camera model and explicit, differentiable defocus rendering, enabling it to function as a post-capture control tool. By training with multi-view images with moderate defocus blur, DOF-GS learns inherent camera characteristics and reconstructs sharp details of the underlying scene, particularly, enabling rendering of varying DOF effects through on-demand aperture and focal distance control, post-capture and optimization. Additionally, our framework extracts circle-of-confusion cues during optimization to identify in-focus regions in input views, enhancing the reconstructed 3D scene details.

Prior work, such as LangSplat, addressed this task by retrieving these regions in the form of segmentation masks on 2D renderings. More recently, OpenGaussian introduced point-level querying, which directly selects a subset of 3D Gaussians. In this work, we propose a point-level querying method that builds upon LangSplat's framework. Our approach improves the framework in two key ways: (a) we leverage masklets from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to establish semantic consistent ground-truth for distilling the language Gaussians; (b) we introduces a novel two-step querying approach that first retrieves the distilled ground-truth and subsequently uses the ground-truth to query the individual Gaussians. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. For instance, our method achieves an mIoU improvement of +20.42 on the 3D-OVS dataset.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21767](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21767) |
| 443 | Gaussian Splatting Lucas-Kanade | Liuyue Xie,Joel Julin,Koichiro Niinuma,Laszlo A. Jeni | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian Splatting and its dynamic extensions are effective for reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D images when there is significant camera movement to facilitate motion parallax and when scene objects remain relatively static. However, in many real-world scenarios, these conditions are not met. As a consequence, data-driven semantic and geometric priors have been favored as regularizers, despite their bias toward training data and their neglect of broader movement dynamics.  Departing from this practice, we propose a novel analytical approach that adapts the classical Lucas-Kanade method to dynamic Gaussian splatting. By leveraging the intrinsic properties of the forward warp field network, we derive an analytical velocity field that, through time integration, facilitates accurate scene flow computation. This enables the precise enforcement of motion constraints on warp fields, thus constraining both 2D motion and 3D positions of the Gaussians. Our method excels in reconstructing highly dynamic scenes with minimal camera movement, as demonstrated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world scenes.</details> | July 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11309](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11309) |

Over the past decade, Deep Learning-based Reconstruction (DLR) methods have led efforts to enhance image quality and reduce noise, yet they often require large amounts of data and are computationally intensive. Inspired by recent advancements in scene reconstruction, some approaches have adapted NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques for CT reconstruction. However, these methods are not ideal for direct 3D volume reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a novel Discretized Gaussian Representation (DGR) for CT reconstruction, which directly reconstructs the 3D volume using a set of discretized Gaussian functions in an end-to-end manner. To further enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a Fast Volume Reconstruction technique that aggregates the contributions of these Gaussians into a discretized volume in a highly parallelized fashion. Our extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DGR achieves superior reconstruction quality and significantly improved computational efficiency compared to existing DLR and instance reconstruction methods. Our code has been provided for review purposes and will be made publicly available upon publication.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04844](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04844) |
| 441 | GI-GS: Global Illumination Decomposition on Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering | Hongze Chen,Zehong Lin,Jun Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present GI-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and deferred shading to achieve photo-realistic novel view synthesis and relighting. In inverse rendering, accurately modeling the shading processes of objects is essential for achieving high-fidelity results. Therefore, it is critical to incorporate global illumination to account for indirect lighting that reaches an object after multiple bounces across the scene. Previous 3DGS-based methods have attempted to model indirect lighting by characterizing indirect illumination as learnable lighting volumes or additional attributes of each Gaussian, while using baked occlusion to represent shadow effects. These methods, however, fail to accurately model the complex physical interactions between light and objects, making it impossible to construct realistic indirect illumination during relighting. To address this limitation, we propose to calculate indirect lighting using efficient path tracing with deferred shading. In our framework, we first render a G-buffer to capture the detailed geometry and material properties of the scene. Then, we perform physically-based rendering (PBR) only for direct lighting. With the G-buffer and previous rendering results, the indirect lighting can be calculated through a lightweight path tracing. Our method effectively models indirect lighting under any given lighting conditions, thereby achieving better novel view synthesis and competitive relighting. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our GI-GS outperforms existing baselines in both rendering quality and efficiency.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02619](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02619) |

| 439 | Dynamics-Aware Gaussian Splatting Streaming Towards Fast On-the-Fly 4D Reconstruction | Zhening Liu,Yingdong Hu,Xinjie Zhang,Rui Song,Jiawei Shao,Zehong Lin,Jun Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has led to great interest in 4D dynamic spatial reconstruction. Existing approaches mainly rely on full-length multi-view videos, while there has been limited exploration of online reconstruction methods that enable on-the-fly training and per-timestep streaming. Current 3DGS-based streaming methods treat the Gaussian primitives uniformly and constantly renew the densified Gaussians, thereby overlooking the difference between dynamic and static features as well as neglecting the temporal continuity in the scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage pipeline for iterative streamable 4D dynamic spatial reconstruction. Our pipeline comprises a selective inheritance stage to preserve temporal continuity, a dynamics-aware shift stage to distinguish dynamic and static primitives and optimize their movements, and an error-guided densification stage to accommodate emerging objects. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in online 4D reconstruction, demonstrating the fastest on-the-fly training, superior representation quality, and real-time rendering capability.

| 438 | OmniSplat: Taming Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting for Omnidirectional Images with Editable Capabilities | Suyoung Lee,Jaeyoung Chung,Kihoon Kim,Jaeyoo Huh,Gunhee Lee,Minsoo Lee,Kyoung Mu Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Feed-forward 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) models have gained significant popularity due to their ability to generate scenes immediately without needing per-scene optimization. Although omnidirectional images are becoming more popular since they reduce the computation required for image stitching to composite a holistic scene, existing feed-forward models are only designed for perspective images. The unique optical properties of omnidirectional images make it difficult for feature encoders to correctly understand the context of the image and make the Gaussian non-uniform in space, which hinders the image quality synthesized from novel views. We propose OmniSplat, a training-free fast feed-forward 3DGS generation framework for omnidirectional images. We adopt a Yin-Yang grid and decompose images based on it to reduce the domain gap between omnidirectional and perspective images. The Yin-Yang grid can use the existing CNN structure as it is, but its quasi-uniform characteristic allows the decomposed image to be similar to a perspective image, so it can exploit the strong prior knowledge of the learned feed-forward network. OmniSplat demonstrates higher reconstruction accuracy than existing feed-forward networks trained on perspective images.

| 437 | Event-boosted Deformable 3D Gaussians for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction | Wenhao Xu,Wenming Weng,Yueyi Zhang,Ruikang Xu,Zhiwei Xiong | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) is limited by missing intermediate motion information due to the low temporal resolution of RGB cameras. To address this, we introduce the first approach combining event cameras, which capture high-temporal-resolution, continuous motion data, with deformable 3D-GS for dynamic scene reconstruction. We observe that threshold modeling for events plays a crucial role in achieving high-quality reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a GS-Threshold Joint Modeling strategy, creating a mutually reinforcing process that greatly improves both 3D reconstruction and threshold modeling. Moreover, we introduce a Dynamic-Static Decomposition strategy that first identifies dynamic areas by exploiting the inability of static Gaussians to represent motions, then applies a buffer-based soft decomposition to separate dynamic and static areas. This strategy accelerates rendering by avoiding unnecessary deformation in static areas, and focuses on dynamic areas to enhance fidelity. Additionally, we contribute the first event-inclusive 4D benchmark with synthetic and real-world dynamic scenes, on which our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16180](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16180) |
| 436 | Frequency-Aware Gaussian Splatting Decomposition | Yishai Lavi,Leo Segre,Shai Avidan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has revolutionized novel view synthesis with its efficient, explicit representation. However, it lacks frequency interpretability, making it difficult to separate low-frequency structures from fine details. We introduce a frequency-decomposed 3D-GS framework that groups 3D Gaussians that correspond to subbands in the Laplacian Pyrmaids of the input images. Our approach enforces coherence within each subband (i.e., group of 3D Gaussians) through dedicated regularization, ensuring well-separated frequency components. We extend color values to both positive and negative ranges, allowing higher-frequency layers to add or subtract residual details. To stabilize optimization, we employ a progressive training scheme that refines details in a coarse-to-fine manner. Beyond interpretability, this frequency-aware design unlocks a range of practical benefits. Explicit frequency separation enables advanced 3D editing and stylization, allowing precise manipulation of specific frequency bands. It also supports dynamic level-of-detail control for progressive rendering, streaming, foveated rendering and fast geometry interaction. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method provides improved control and flexibility for emerging applications in scene editing and interactive rendering.

| 435 | StyledStreets: Multi-style Street Simulator with Spatial and Temporal Consistency | Yuyin Chen,Yida Wang,Xueyang Zhang,Kun Zhan,Peng Jia,Yifei Zhan,Xianpeng Lang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Urban scene reconstruction requires modeling both static infrastructure and dynamic elements while supporting diverse environmental conditions. We present \\textbf{StyledStreets}, a multi-style street simulator that achieves instruction-driven scene editing with guaranteed spatial and temporal consistency. Building on a state-of-the-art Gaussian Splatting framework for street scenarios enhanced by our proposed pose optimization and multi-view training, our method enables photorealistic style transfers across seasons, weather conditions, and camera setups through three key innovations: First, a hybrid embedding scheme disentangles persistent scene geometry from transient style attributes, allowing realistic environmental edits while preserving structural integrity. Second, uncertainty-aware rendering mitigates supervision noise from diffusion priors, enabling robust training across extreme style variations. Third, a unified parametric model prevents geometric drift through regularized updates, maintaining multi-view consistency across seven vehicle-mounted cameras.  Our framework preserves the original scene's motion patterns and geometric relationships. Qualitative results demonstrate plausible transitions between diverse conditions (snow, sandstorm, night), while quantitative evaluations show state-of-the-art geometric accuracy under style transfers. The approach establishes new capabilities for urban simulation, with applications in autonomous vehicle testing and augmented reality systems requiring reliable environmental consistency.

| 434 | SplatFlow: Self-Supervised Dynamic Gaussian Splatting in Neural Motion Flow Field for Autonomous Driving | Su Sun,Cheng Zhao,Zhuoyang Sun,Yingjie Victor Chen,Mei Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Most existing Dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods for complex dynamic urban scenarios rely on accurate object-level supervision from expensive manual labeling, limiting their scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce SplatFlow, a Self-Supervised Dynamic Gaussian Splatting within Neural Motion Flow Fields (NMFF) to learn 4D space-time representations without requiring tracked 3D bounding boxes, enabling accurate dynamic scene reconstruction and novel view RGB/depth/flow synthesis. SplatFlow designs a unified framework to seamlessly integrate time-dependent 4D Gaussian representation within NMFF, where NMFF is a set of implicit functions to model temporal motions of both LiDAR points and Gaussians as continuous motion flow fields. Leveraging NMFF, SplatFlow effectively decomposes static background and dynamic objects, representing them with 3D and 4D Gaussian primitives, respectively. NMFF also models the correspondences of each 4D Gaussian across time, which aggregates temporal features to enhance cross-view consistency of dynamic components. SplatFlow further improves dynamic object identification by distilling features from 2D foundation models into 4D space-time representation. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the Waymo and KITTI Datasets validate SplatFlow's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for both image reconstruction and novel view synthesis in dynamic urban scenarios.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15482](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15482) |

However, this technique requires dense training views to accurately reconstruct 3D geometry. A limited number of input views will significantly degrade reconstruction quality, resulting in artifacts such as "floaters" and "background collapse" at unseen viewpoints. In this work, we introduce SparseGS, an efficient training pipeline designed to address the limitations of 3DGS in scenarios with sparse training views. SparseGS incorporates depth priors, novel depth rendering techniques, and a pruning heuristic to mitigate floater artifacts, alongside an Unseen Viewpoint Regularization module to alleviate background collapses. Our extensive evaluations on the Mip-NeRF360, LLFF, and DTU datasets demonstrate that SparseGS achieves high-quality reconstruction in both unbounded and forward-facing scenarios, with as few as 12 and 3 input images, respectively, while maintaining fast training and real-time rendering capabilities.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00206](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00206) |

In contrast, our method only requires a multi-view capture of a single static frame. We represent garments as hybrid mesh-embedded 3D Gaussian splats, where the Gaussians capture near-field shading and high-frequency details, while the mesh encodes far-field albedo and optimized reflectance parameters. We achieve novel pose generalization by exploiting the mesh from our hybrid approach, enabling physics-based simulation and surface rendering techniques, while also capturing fine details with Gaussians that accurately reconstruct garment details. Our optimized garments can be used for simulating garments on novel poses, and garment relighting.

| 431 | 4DRGS: 4D Radiative Gaussian Splatting for Efficient 3D Vessel Reconstruction from Sparse-View Dynamic DSA Images | Zhentao Liu,Ruyi Zha,Huangxuan Zhao,Hongdong Li,Zhiming Cui | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing 3D vessel structures from sparse-view dynamic digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images enables accurate medical assessment while reducing radiation exposure. Existing methods often produce suboptimal results or require excessive computation time. In this work, we propose 4D radiative Gaussian splatting (4DRGS) to achieve high-quality reconstruction efficiently. In detail, we represent the vessels with 4D radiative Gaussian kernels. Each kernel has time-invariant geometry parameters, including position, rotation, and scale, to model static vessel structures. The time-dependent central attenuation of each kernel is predicted from a compact neural network to capture the temporal varying response of contrast agent flow. We splat these Gaussian kernels to synthesize DSA images via X-ray rasterization and optimize the model with real captured ones. The final 3D vessel volume is voxelized from the well-trained kernels. Moreover, we introduce accumulated attenuation pruning and bounded scaling activation to improve reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on real-world patient data demonstrate that 4DRGS achieves impressive results in 5 minutes training, which is 32x faster than the state-of-the-art method. This underscores the potential of 4DRGS for real-world clinics.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12919](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12919) |
| 430 | DeSplat: Decomposed Gaussian Splatting for Distractor-Free Rendering | Yihao Wang,Marcus Klasson,Matias Turkulainen,Shuzhe Wang,Juho Kannala,Arno Solin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian splatting enables fast novel view synthesis in static 3D environments. However, reconstructing real-world environments remains challenging as distractors or occluders break the multi-view consistency assumption required for accurate 3D reconstruction. Most existing methods rely on external semantic information from pre-trained models, introducing additional computational overhead as pre-processing steps or during optimization. In this work, we propose a novel method, DeSplat, that directly separates distractors and static scene elements purely based on volume rendering of Gaussian primitives. We initialize Gaussians within each camera view for reconstructing the view-specific distractors to separately model the static 3D scene and distractors in the alpha compositing stages. DeSplat yields an explicit scene separation of static elements and distractors, achieving comparable results to prior distractor-free approaches without sacrificing rendering speed. We demonstrate DeSplat's effectiveness on three benchmark data sets for distractor-free novel view synthesis.

In this paper, we propose DashGaussian, a scheduling scheme over the optimization complexity of 3DGS that strips redundant complexity to accelerate 3DGS optimization. Specifically, we formulate 3DGS optimization as progressively fitting 3DGS to higher levels of frequency components in the training views, and propose a dynamic rendering resolution scheme that largely reduces the optimization complexity based on this formulation. Besides, we argue that a specific rendering resolution should cooperate with a proper primitive number for a better balance between computing redundancy and fitting quality, where we schedule the growth of the primitives to synchronize with the rendering resolution. Extensive experiments show that our method accelerates the optimization of various 3DGS backbones by 45.7% on average while preserving the rendering quality.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18402](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18402) |

| 427 | COB-GS: Clear Object Boundaries in 3DGS Segmentation Based on Boundary-Adaptive Gaussian Splitting | Jiaxin Zhang,Junjun Jiang,Youyu Chen,Kui Jiang,Xianming Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Accurate object segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D segmentation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles with accurately delineating object boundaries, as Gaussian primitives often span across object edges due to their inherent volume and the lack of semantic guidance during training. In order to tackle these challenges, we introduce Clear Object Boundaries for 3DGS Segmentation (COB-GS), which aims to improve segmentation accuracy by clearly delineating blurry boundaries of interwoven Gaussian primitives within the scene. Unlike existing approaches that remove ambiguous Gaussians and sacrifice visual quality, COB-GS, as a 3DGS refinement method, jointly optimizes semantic and visual information, allowing the two different levels to cooperate with each other effectively. Specifically, for the semantic guidance, we introduce a boundary-adaptive Gaussian splitting technique that leverages semantic gradient statistics to identify and split ambiguous Gaussians, aligning them closely with object boundaries. For the visual optimization, we rectify the degraded suboptimal texture of the 3DGS scene, particularly along the refined boundary structures. Experimental results show that COB-GS substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against inaccurate masks from pre-trained model, yielding clear boundaries while preserving high visual quality.

| 426 | TC-GS: Tri-plane based compression for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Taorui Wang,Zitong Yu,Yong Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent framework for novel view synthesis, providing high fidelity and rapid rendering speed. However, the substantial data volume of 3DGS and its attributes impede its practical utility, requiring compression techniques for reducing memory cost. Nevertheless, the unorganized shape of 3DGS leads to difficulties in compression. To formulate unstructured attributes into normative distribution, we propose a well-structured tri-plane to encode Gaussian attributes, leveraging the distribution of attributes for compression. To exploit the correlations among adjacent Gaussians, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is used when decoding Gaussian distribution from the Tri-plane. We also introduce Gaussian position information as a prior of the position-sensitive decoder. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive wavelet loss, aiming to focus on the high-frequency details as iterations increase.

In this work, we tackle the more challenging and underexplored Extrapolated View Synthesis (EVS) task. Here we enable GS-based models trained with limited view coverage to generalize well to extrapolated views. To achieve our goal, we propose a view augmentation framework to guide training through a coarse-to-fine process. At the coarse stage, we reduce rendering artifacts due to insufficient view coverage by introducing a regularization strategy at both appearance and geometry levels. At the fine stage, we generate reliable view priors to provide further training guidance. To this end, we incorporate an occlusion awareness into the view prior generation process, and refine the view priors with the aid of coarse stage output. We call our framework Enhanced View Prior Guidance for Splatting (EVPGS). To comprehensively evaluate EVPGS on the EVS task, we collect a real-world dataset called Merchandise3D dedicated to the EVS scenario. Experiments on three datasets including both real and synthetic demonstrate EVPGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, while improving synthesis quality at extrapolated views for GS-based methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

| 421 | Thin-Shell-SfT: Fine-Grained Monocular Non-rigid 3D Surface Tracking with Neural Deformation Fields | Navami Kairanda,Marc Habermann,Shanthika Naik,Christian Theobalt,Vladislav Golyanik | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D reconstruction of highly deformable surfaces (e.g. cloths) from monocular RGB videos is a challenging problem, and no solution provides a consistent and accurate recovery of fine-grained surface details. To account for the ill-posed nature of the setting, existing methods use deformation models with statistical, neural, or physical priors. They also predominantly rely on nonadaptive discrete surface representations (e.g. polygonal meshes), perform frame-by-frame optimisation leading to error propagation, and suffer from poor gradients of the mesh-based differentiable renderers. Consequently, fine surface details such as cloth wrinkles are often not recovered with the desired accuracy. In response to these limitations, we propose ThinShell-SfT, a new method for non-rigid 3D tracking that represents a surface as an implicit and continuous spatiotemporal neural field. We incorporate continuous thin shell physics prior based on the Kirchhoff-Love model for spatial regularisation, which starkly contrasts the discretised alternatives of earlier works. Lastly, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting to differentiably render the surface into image space and optimise the deformations based on analysis-bysynthesis principles. Our Thin-Shell-SfT outperforms prior works qualitatively and quantitatively thanks to our continuous surface formulation in conjunction with a specially tailored simulation prior and surface-induced 3D Gaussians.

| 420 | Visualizing the Invisible: A Generative AR System for Intuitive Multi-Modal Sensor Data Presentation | Yunqi Guo,Kaiyuan Hou,Heming Fu,Hongkai Chen,Zhenyu Yan,Guoliang Xing,Xiaofan Jiang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Understanding sensor data can be difficult for non-experts because of the complexity and different semantic meanings of sensor modalities. This leads to a need for intuitive and effective methods to present sensor information. However, creating intuitive sensor data visualizations presents three key challenges: the variability of sensor readings, gaps in domain comprehension, and the dynamic nature of sensor data. To address these issues, we propose Vivar, a novel system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D volumetric content for AR visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding space through barycentric interpolation. This approach accurately reflects value changes in multi-modal sensor information, ensuring that sensor variations are properly shown in visualization outcomes. Vivar also incorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition, Vivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR content generation, demonstrating 11x latency reduction without compromising quality. A user study involving over 503 participants, including domain experts, demonstrates Vivar's effectiveness in accuracy, consistency, and real-world applicability, paving the way for more intuitive sensor data visualization.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13509](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13509) |

Previous methods extending 3DGS to model dynamic scenes have struggled to represent specular surfaces accurately. Our method addresses this limitation by introducing a residual correction technique for accurate surface normal computation during deformation, complemented by a deformable environment map that adapts to time-varying lighting conditions.

In this paper, we present DepthSplat to connect Gaussian splatting and depth estimation and study their interactions. More specifically, we first contribute a robust multi-view depth model by leveraging pre-trained monocular depth features, leading to high-quality feed-forward 3D Gaussian splatting reconstructions. We also show that Gaussian splatting can serve as an unsupervised pre-training objective for learning powerful depth models from large-scale multi-view posed datasets. We validate the synergy between Gaussian splatting and depth estimation through extensive ablation and cross-task transfer experiments. Our DepthSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets in terms of both depth estimation and novel view synthesis, demonstrating the mutual benefits of connecting both tasks.

Traditional TDOM generation methods need sophisticated processes, such as Digital Surface Models (DSM) and occlusion detection, which are computationally expensive and prone to errors. This work presents an alternative technique rooted in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), free of explicit DSM and occlusion detection. With depth map generation, spatial information for every pixel within the TDOM is retrieved and can reconstruct the scene with high precision. Divide-and-conquer strategy achieves excellent GS training and rendering with high-resolution TDOMs at a lower resource cost, which preserves higher quality of rendering on complex terrain and thin structure without a decrease in efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of large-scale scene reconstruction and high-precision terrain modeling. This approach provides accurate spatial data, which assists users in better planning and decision-making based on maps.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19703](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19703) |

CoMapGS addresses both high- and low-uncertainty regions by constructing covisibility maps, enhancing initial point clouds, and applying uncertainty-aware weighted supervision using a proximity classifier. Our contributions are threefold: (1) CoMapGS reframes novel view synthesis by leveraging covisibility maps as a core component to address region-specific uncertainty; (2) Enhanced initial point clouds for both low- and high-uncertainty regions compensate for sparse COLMAP-derived point clouds, improving reconstruction quality and benefiting few-shot 3DGS methods; (3) Adaptive supervision with covisibility-score-based weighting and proximity classification achieves consistent performance gains across scenes with varying sparsity scores derived from covisibility maps.

| 414 | SparseGS-W: Sparse-View 3D Gaussian Splatting in the Wild with Generative Priors | Yiqing Li,Xuan Wang,Jiawei Wu,Yikun Ma,Zhi Jin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Synthesizing novel views of large-scale scenes from unconstrained in-the-wild images is an important but challenging task in computer vision. Existing methods, which optimize per-image appearance and transient occlusion through implicit neural networks from dense training views (approximately 1000 images), struggle to perform effectively under sparse input conditions, resulting in noticeable artifacts. To this end, we propose SparseGS-W, a novel framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables the reconstruction of complex outdoor scenes and handles occlusions and appearance changes with as few as five training images. We leverage geometric priors and constrained diffusion priors to compensate for the lack of multi-view information from extremely sparse input. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Constrained Novel-View Enhancement module to iteratively improve the quality of rendered novel views during the Gaussian optimization process. Furthermore, we propose an Occlusion Handling module, which flexibly removes occlusions utilizing the inherent high-quality inpainting capability of constrained diffusion priors. Both modules are capable of extracting appearance features from any user-provided reference image, enabling flexible modeling of illumination-consistent scenes. Extensive experiments on the PhotoTourism and Tanks and Temples datasets demonstrate that SparseGS-W achieves state-of-the-art performance not only in full-reference metrics, but also in commonly used non-reference metrics such as FID, ClipIQA, and MUSIQ.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19452](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19452) |

STDLoc is a full relocalization pipeline that can achieve accurate relocalization without relying on any pose prior. Unlike previous coarse-to-fine localization methods that require image retrieval first and then feature matching, we propose a novel sparse-to-dense localization paradigm. Based on this scene representation, we introduce a novel matching-oriented Gaussian sampling strategy and a scene-specific detector to achieve efficient and robust initial pose estimation. Furthermore, based on the initial localization results, we align the query feature map to the Gaussian feature field by dense feature matching to enable accurate localization. The experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that STDLoc outperforms current state-of-the-art localization methods in terms of localization accuracy and recall.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19358](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19358) |

Consequently, copyright protection via watermarking has become critical. However, because 3DGS relies on millions of Gaussians, which require gigabytes of storage, efficient transfer and storage require compression. Existing 3DGS watermarking methods are vulnerable to quantization-based compression, often resulting in the loss of the embedded watermark. To address this challenge, we propose a novel watermarking method that ensures watermark robustness after model compression while maintaining high rendering quality. In detail, we incorporate a quantization distortion layer that simulates compression during training, preserving the watermark under quantization-based compression. Also, we propose a learnable watermark embedding feature that embeds the watermark into the anchor feature, ensuring structural consistency and seamless integration into the 3D scene. Furthermore, we present a frequency-aware anchor growing mechanism to enhance image quality in high-frequency regions by effectively identifying Guassians within these regions. Experimental results confirm that our method preserves the watermark and maintains superior image quality under high compression, validating it as a promising approach for a secure 3DGS model.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12836](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12836) |

Directly applying static methods to understand dynamic scenes will fail to capture the temporal features. Few works focus on dynamic scene understanding based on Gaussian Splatting, since once the same update strategy is employed for both dynamic and static parts, regardless of the distinction and interaction between Gaussians, significant artifacts and noise appear. We propose Dual-Hierarchical Optimization (DHO), which consists of Hierarchical Gaussian Flow and Hierarchical Gaussian Guidance in a divide-and-conquer manner. The former implements effective division of static and dynamic rendering and features. The latter helps to mitigate the issue of dynamic foreground rendering distortion in textured complex scenes. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms the baselines on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and supports various downstream tasks.

Compared to frame-based camera, a novel type of bio-inspired visual sensor, i.e. event camera, has demonstrated advantages in high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low power consumption and low latency. Due to its unique asynchronous and irregular data capturing process, limited work has been proposed to apply neural representation or 3D Gaussian splatting for an event camera. In this work, we present IncEventGS, an incremental 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction algorithm with a single event camera. To recover the 3D scene representation incrementally, we exploit the tracking and mapping paradigm of conventional SLAM pipelines for IncEventGS. Given the incoming event stream, the tracker firstly estimates an initial camera motion based on prior reconstructed 3D-GS scene representation. The mapper then jointly refines both the 3D scene representation and camera motion based on the previously estimated motion trajectory from the tracker. The experimental results demonstrate that IncEventGS delivers superior performance compared to prior NeRF-based methods and other related baselines, even we do not have the ground-truth camera poses. Furthermore, our method can also deliver better performance compared to state-of-the-art event visual odometry methods in terms of camera motion estimation.

However, reliance on Cartesian coordinates limits 3DGS's performance on distant objects, which is important for reconstructing unbounded outdoor environments. We found that, despite its ultimate simplicity, using homogeneous coordinates, a concept on the projective geometry, for the 3DGS pipeline remarkably improves the rendering accuracies of distant objects. We therefore propose Homogeneous Gaussian Splatting (HoGS) incorporating homogeneous coordinates into the 3DGS framework, providing a unified representation for enhancing near and distant objects. HoGS effectively manages both expansive spatial positions and scales particularly in outdoor unbounded environments by adopting projective geometry principles. Experiments show that HoGS significantly enhances accuracy in reconstructing distant objects while maintaining high-quality rendering of nearby objects, along with fast training speed and real-time rendering capability.

The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising approach for real-time dense 3D reconstruction. However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems struggle to balance hardware simplicity, speed, and map quality. Most systems excel in one or two of the aforementioned aspects but rarely achieve all. A key issue is the difficulty of initializing 3D Gaussians while concurrently conducting SLAM. To address these challenges, we present Monocular GSO (MGSO), a novel real-time SLAM system that integrates photometric SLAM with 3DGS. Photometric SLAM provides dense structured point clouds for 3DGS initialization, accelerating optimization and producing more efficient maps with fewer Gaussians. As a result, experiments show that our system generates reconstructions with a balance of quality, memory efficiency, and speed that outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our system achieves all results using RGB inputs. We evaluate the Replica, TUM-RGBD, and EuRoC datasets against current live dense reconstruction systems. Not only do we surpass contemporary systems, but experiments also show that we maintain our performance on laptop hardware, making it a practical solution for robotics, A/R, and other real-time applications.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13055](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13055) |

However, its rendering speed and model size still present bottlenecks, especially in resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we identify and address two key inefficiencies in 3D-GS to substantially improve rendering speed. These improvements also yield the ancillary benefits of reduced model size and training time. First, we optimize the rendering pipeline to precisely localize Gaussians in the scene, boosting rendering speed without altering visual fidelity. Second, we introduce a novel pruning technique and integrate it into the training pipeline, significantly reducing model size and training time while further raising rendering speed.

However, due to its rasterization-based formulation, 3DGS is constrained to ideal pinhole cameras and lacks support for secondary lighting effects. Recent methods address these limitations by tracing the particles instead, but, this comes at the cost of significantly slower rendering. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian Unscented Transform (3DGUT), replacing the EWA splatting formulation with the Unscented Transform that approximates the particles through sigma points, which can be projected exactly under any nonlinear projection function. This modification enables trivial support of distorted cameras with time dependent effects such as rolling shutter, while retaining the efficiency of rasterization. Additionally, we align our rendering formulation with that of tracing-based methods, enabling secondary ray tracing required to represent phenomena such as reflections and refraction within the same 3D representation.

However, complex scenes can consist of millions of Gaussians, resulting in high storage and memory requirements that limit the viability of 3D-GS on devices with limited resources. Current techniques for compressing these pretrained models by pruning Gaussians rely on combining heuristics to determine which Gaussians to remove. At high compression ratios, these pruned scenes suffer from heavy degradation of visual fidelity and loss of foreground details. In this paper, we propose a principled sensitivity pruning score that preserves visual fidelity and foreground details at significantly higher compression ratios than existing approaches. It is computed as a second-order approximation of the reconstruction error on the training views with respect to the spatial parameters of each Gaussian. Additionally, we propose a multi-round prune-refine pipeline that can be applied to any pretrained 3D-GS model without changing its training pipeline. After pruning 90% of Gaussians, a substantially higher percentage than previous methods, our PUP 3D-GS pipeline increases average rendering speed by 3.56$\\times$ while retaining more salient foreground information and achieving higher image quality metrics than existing techniques on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10219](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10219) |

However, these methods struggle in few-shot scenarios due to limited supervision. In this paper, we present NexusGS, a 3DGS-based approach that enhances novel view synthesis from sparse-view images by directly embedding depth information into point clouds, without relying on complex manual regularizations. Exploiting the inherent epipolar geometry of 3DGS, our method introduces a novel point cloud densification strategy that initializes 3DGS with a dense point cloud, reducing randomness in point placement while preventing over-smoothing and overfitting. Specifically, NexusGS comprises three key steps: Epipolar Depth Nexus, Flow-Resilient Depth Blending, and Flow-Filtered Depth Pruning. These steps leverage optical flow and camera poses to compute accurate depth maps, while mitigating the inaccuracies often associated with optical flow. By incorporating epipolar depth priors, NexusGS ensures reliable dense point cloud coverage and supports stable 3DGS training under sparse-view conditions. Experiments demonstrate that NexusGS significantly enhances depth accuracy and rendering quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin. Furthermore, we validate the superiority of our generated point clouds by substantially boosting the performance of competing methods.

Previous works have attempted to address this issue by deforming a NeRF in canonical space or manipulating the radiance field based on an explicit mesh. However, manipulating NeRF is not highly controllable and requires a long training and inference time. With the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), extremely high-fidelity novel view synthesis can be achieved using an explicit point-based 3D representation with much faster training and rendering speed. However, there is still a lack of effective means to manipulate 3DGS freely while maintaining rendering quality. In this work, we aim to tackle the challenge of achieving manipulable photo-realistic rendering. We propose to utilize a triangular mesh to manipulate 3DGS directly with self-adaptation. This approach reduces the need to design various algorithms for different types of Gaussian manipulation. By utilizing a triangle shape-aware Gaussian binding and adapting method, we can achieve 3DGS manipulation and preserve high-fidelity rendering after manipulation. Our approach is capable of handling large deformations, local manipulations, and soft body simulations while keeping high-quality rendering. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is also effective with inaccurate meshes extracted from 3DGS. Experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over baseline approaches.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17811](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17811) |
| 399 | GS-Marker: Generalizable and Robust Watermarking for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Lijiang Li,Jinglu Wang,Xiang Ming,Yan Lu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In the Generative AI era, safeguarding 3D models has become increasingly urgent. While invisible watermarking is well-established for 2D images with encoder-decoder frameworks, generalizable and robust solutions for 3D remain elusive. The main difficulty arises from the renderer between the 3D encoder and 2D decoder, which disrupts direct gradient flow and complicates training. Existing 3D methods typically rely on per-scene iterative optimization, resulting in time inefficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a single-pass watermarking approach for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a well-known yet underexplored representation for watermarking. We identify two major challenges: (1) ensuring effective training generalized across diverse 3D models, and (2) reliably extracting watermarks from free-view renderings, even under distortions. Our framework, named GS-Marker, incorporates a 3D encoder to embed messages, distortion layers to enhance resilience against various distortions, and a 2D decoder to extract watermarks from renderings. A key innovation is the Adaptive Marker Control mechanism that adaptively perturbs the initially optimized 3DGS, escaping local minima and improving both training stability and convergence. Extensive experiments show that GS-Marker outperforms per-scene training approaches in terms of decoding accuracy and model fidelity, while also significantly reducing computation time.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18718](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18718) |

Simply using enhanced images as inputs would lead to issues with multi-view consistency, and current single-view enhancement systems rely on pre-trained data, lacking scene generalization. These problems limit the application of 3D Gaussian Splatting in low-light conditions in the field of robotics, including high-fidelity modeling and feature matching. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised multi-view stereoscopic system based on Gaussian Splatting, called Low-Light Gaussian Splatting (LLGS). This system aims to enhance images in low-light environments while reconstructing the scene. Our method introduces a decomposable Gaussian representation called M-Color, which separately characterizes color information for targeted enhancement. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised optimization method with zero-knowledge priors, using direction-based enhancement to ensure multi-view consistency. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both low-light enhancement and 3D Gaussian Splatting.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18640](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18640) |

In this paper, we introduce GaussTR, a novel Gaussian-based Transformer framework that unifies sparse 3D modeling with foundation model alignment through Gaussian representations to advance 3D spatial understanding. GaussTR predicts sparse sets of Gaussians in a feed-forward manner to represent 3D scenes. By splatting the Gaussians into 2D views and aligning the rendered features with foundation models, GaussTR facilitates self-supervised 3D representation learning and enables open-vocabulary semantic occupancy prediction without requiring explicit annotations. Empirical experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset demonstrate GaussTR's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance of 12.27 mIoU, along with a 40% reduction in training time.

However, the vast number of Gaussians and their associated attributes poses significant challenges for storage and transmission. Existing methods typically handle dynamic 3DGS representation and compression separately, neglecting motion information and the rate-distortion (RD) trade-off during training, leading to performance degradation and increased model redundancy. To address this gap, we propose 4DGC, a novel rate-aware 4D Gaussian compression framework that significantly reduces storage size while maintaining superior RD performance for FVV. Specifically, 4DGC introduces a motion-aware dynamic Gaussian representation that utilizes a compact motion grid combined with sparse compensated Gaussians to exploit inter-frame similarities. This representation effectively handles large motions, preserving quality and reducing temporal redundancy. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end compression scheme that employs differentiable quantization and a tiny implicit entropy model to compress the motion grid and compensated Gaussians efficiently. The entire framework is jointly optimized using a rate-distortion trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4DGC supports variable bitrates and consistently outperforms existing methods in RD performance across multiple datasets.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18421](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18421) |

Despite delivering remarkable rendering quality and speed, existing methods struggle with storage demands and representing complex real-world motions. To tackle these issues, we propose MoDecGS, a memory-efficient Gaussian splatting framework designed for reconstructing novel views in challenging scenarios with complex motions. We introduce GlobaltoLocal Motion Decomposition (GLMD) to effectively capture dynamic motions in a coarsetofine manner. This approach leverages Global Canonical Scaffolds (Global CS) and Local Canonical Scaffolds (Local CS), extending static Scaffold representation to dynamic video reconstruction. For Global CS, we propose Global Anchor Deformation (GAD) to efficiently represent global dynamics along complex motions, by directly deforming the implicit Scaffold attributes which are anchor position, offset, and local context features. Next, we finely adjust local motions via the Local Gaussian Deformation (LGD) of Local CS explicitly. Additionally, we introduce Temporal Interval Adjustment (TIA) to automatically control the temporal coverage of each Local CS during training, allowing MoDecGS to find optimal interval assignments based on the specified number of temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MoDecGS achieves an average 70% reduction in model size over stateoftheart methods for dynamic 3D Gaussians from realworld dynamic videos while maintaining or even improving rendering quality.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03714](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03714) |

Neural rendering techniques, which utilize collected raw sensor data to simulate these dynamic environments, have emerged as a leading methodology. While NeRF-based approaches can uniformly represent scenes for rendering data from both camera and LiDAR, they are hindered by slow rendering speeds due to dense sampling. Conversely, Gaussian Splatting-based methods employ Gaussian primitives for scene representation and achieve rapid rendering through rasterization. However, these rasterization-based techniques struggle to accurately model non-linear optical sensors. This limitation restricts their applicability to sensors beyond pinhole cameras. To address these challenges and enable unified representation of dynamic driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, this study proposes a novel hybrid approach. Our method utilizes rasterization for rendering image data while employing Gaussian ray-tracing for LiDAR data rendering. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This work presents a unified and efficient solution for realistic simulation of camera and LiDAR data in autonomous driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, offering significant advancements in both rendering quality and computational efficiency.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08317](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08317) |

While recent advances leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity and real-time rendering, existing methods are often specialized and task-focused, lacking a unified framework for both generation and editing. In this paper, we introduce SplatFlow, a comprehensive framework that addresses this gap by enabling direct 3DGS generation and editing. SplatFlow comprises two main components: a multi-view rectified flow (RF) model and a Gaussian Splatting Decoder (GSDecoder). The multi-view RF model operates in latent space, generating multi-view images, depths, and camera poses simultaneously, conditioned on text prompts, thus addressing challenges like diverse scene scales and complex camera trajectories in real-world settings. Then, the GSDecoder efficiently translates these latent outputs into 3DGS representations through a feed-forward 3DGS method. Leveraging training-free inversion and inpainting techniques, SplatFlow enables seamless 3DGS editing and supports a broad range of 3D tasks-including object editing, novel view synthesis, and camera pose estimation-within a unified framework without requiring additional complex pipelines. We validate SplatFlow's capabilities on the MVImgNet and DL3DV-7K datasets, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in various 3D generation, editing, and inpainting-based tasks.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16443](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16443) |
| 391 | IRGS: Inter-Reflective Gaussian Splatting with 2D Gaussian Ray Tracing | Chun Gu,Xiaofei Wei,Zixuan Zeng,Yuxuan Yao,Li Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In inverse rendering, accurately modeling visibility and indirect radiance for incident light is essential for capturing secondary effects. Due to the absence of a powerful Gaussian ray tracer, previous 3DGS-based methods have either adopted a simplified rendering equation or used learnable parameters to approximate incident light, resulting in inaccurate material and lighting estimations. To this end, we introduce inter-reflective Gaussian splatting (IRGS) for inverse rendering. To capture inter-reflection, we apply the full rendering equation without simplification and compute incident radiance on the fly using the proposed differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing. Additionally, we present an efficient optimization scheme to handle the computational demands of Monte Carlo sampling for rendering equation evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel strategy for querying the indirect radiance of incident light when relighting the optimized scenes.

Nevertheless, developing an effective channel modeling approach has been a long-standing challenge. This issue has been escalated due to denser network deployment, larger antenna arrays, and broader bandwidth in next-generation networks. To address this challenge, we put forth WRF-GS, a novel framework for channel modeling based on wireless radiation field (WRF) reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS). WRF-GS employs 3D Gaussian primitives and neural networks to capture the interactions between the environment and radio signals, enabling efficient WRF reconstruction and visualization of the propagation characteristics. The reconstructed WRF can then be used to synthesize the spatial spectrum for comprehensive wireless channel characterization. While WRF-GS demonstrates remarkable effectiveness, it faces limitations in capturing high-frequency signal variations caused by complex multipath effects. To overcome these limitations, we propose WRF-GS+, an enhanced framework that integrates electromagnetic wave physics into the neural network design. WRF-GS+ leverages deformable 3D Gaussians to model both static and dynamic components of the WRF, significantly improving its ability to characterize signal variations. In addition, WRF-GS+ enhances the splatting process by simplifying the 3D-GS modeling process and improving computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that both WRF-GS and WRF-GS+ outperform baselines for spatial spectrum synthesis, including ray tracing and other deep-learning approaches. Notably, WRF-GS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance in the received signal strength indication (RSSI) and channel state information (CSI) prediction tasks, surpassing existing methods by more than 0.7 dB and 3.36 dB, respectively.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04832](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04832) |

As a result, wide-baseline panorama view synthesis has emerged as a vital task, where high resolution, fast inference, and memory efficiency are essential. Nevertheless, existing methods are typically constrained to lower resolutions (512 $\\times$ 1024) due to demanding memory and computational requirements. In this paper, we present PanSplat, a generalizable, feed-forward approach that efficiently supports resolution up to 4K (2048 $\\times$ 4096). Our approach features a tailored spherical 3D Gaussian pyramid with a Fibonacci lattice arrangement, enhancing image quality while reducing information redundancy. To accommodate the demands of high resolution, we propose a pipeline that integrates a hierarchical spherical cost volume and Gaussian heads with local operations, enabling two-step deferred backpropagation for memory-efficient training on a single A100 GPU.

Developing an effective and efficient algorithm that is capable of automatically generating high-quality PBR materials rather than RGB texture for 3D meshes can significantly streamline the 3D content creation. Most existing methods leverage pre-trained 2D diffusion models for multi-view image synthesis, which often leads to severe inconsistency between the generated textures and input 3D meshes. This paper presents TexGaussian, a novel method that uses octant-aligned 3D Gaussian Splatting for rapid PBR material generation. Specifically, we place each 3D Gaussian on the finest leaf node of the octree built from the input 3D mesh to render the multi-view images not only for the albedo map but also for roughness and metallic. Moreover, our model is trained in a regression manner instead of diffusion denoising, capable of generating the PBR material for a 3D mesh in a single feed-forward process. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our method synthesizes more visually pleasing PBR materials and runs faster than previous methods in both unconditional and text-conditional scenarios, exhibiting better consistency with the given geometry.

However, collecting large-scale real-world data is expensive and time-consuming, making high-fidelity synthetic data essential for enhancing data diversity and model robustness. Existing driving simulators for synthetic data generation have significant limitations: game-engine-based simulators struggle to produce realistic sensor data, while NeRF-based and diffusion-based methods face efficiency challenges. Additionally, recent simulators designed for closed-loop evaluation provide limited interaction with other vehicles, failing to simulate complex real-world traffic dynamics. To address these issues, we introduce SceneCrafter, a realistic, interactive, and efficient AD simulator based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). SceneCrafter not only efficiently generates realistic driving logs across diverse traffic scenarios but also enables robust closed-loop evaluation of end-to-end models.

However, previous methods cannot distinguish 3D instance-level information, which usually predicts a heatmap between the scene feature and text query. In this paper, we propose PanoGS, a novel and effective 3D panoptic open vocabulary scene understanding approach. Technically, to learn accurate 3D language features that can scale to large indoor scenarios, we adopt the pyramid tri-plane to model the latent continuous parametric feature space and use a 3D feature decoder to regress the multi-view fused 2D feature cloud. Besides, we propose language-guided graph cuts that synergistically leverage reconstructed geometry and learned language cues to group 3D Gaussian primitives into a set of super-primitives. To obtain 3D consistent instance, we perform graph clustering based segmentation with SAM-guided edge affinity computation between different super-primitives.

Recently, methods have been proposed for 3D scene understanding based on Gaussian splatting. However, these methods are multi-staged, suffering from the accumulated errors and the dependence of hand-designed components. To streamline the pipeline and achieve global optimization, we propose PanopticSplatting, an end-to-end system for open-vocabulary panoptic reconstruction. Our method introduces query-guided Gaussian segmentation with local cross attention, lifting 2D instance masks without cross-frame association in an end-to-end way. The local cross attention within view frustum effectively reduces the training memory, making our model more accessible to large scenes with more Gaussians and objects. In addition, to address the challenge of noisy labels in 2D pseudo masks, we propose label blending to promote consistent 3D segmentation with less noisy floaters, as well as label warping on 2D predictions which enhances multi-view coherence and segmentation accuracy. Our method demonstrates strong performances in 3D scene panoptic reconstruction on the ScanNet-V2 and ScanNet++ datasets, compared with both NeRF-based and Gaussian-based panoptic reconstruction methods.

With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

Meanwhile, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as the de facto standard for 3D scene representation across various vision tasks. However, effectively integrating semantic reasoning into 3DGS in a generalizable fashion remains an open challenge. To address these limitations we introduce SceneSplat, to our knowledge the first large-scale 3D indoor scene understanding approach that operates natively on 3DGS. Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised learning scheme that unlocks rich 3D feature learning from unlabeled scenes. In order to power the proposed methods, we introduce SceneSplat-7K, the first large-scale 3DGS dataset for indoor scenes, comprising of 6868 scenes derived from 7 established datasets like ScanNet, Matterport3D, etc. Generating SceneSplat-7K required computational resources equivalent to 119 GPU-days on an L4 GPU, enabling standardized benchmarking for 3DGS-based reasoning for indoor scenes.

| 378 | GaussianFocus: Constrained Attention Focus for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Zexu Huang,Min Xu,Stuart Perry | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent developments in 3D reconstruction and neural rendering have significantly propelled the capabilities of photo-realistic 3D scene rendering across various academic and industrial fields. The 3D Gaussian Splatting technique, alongside its derivatives, integrates the advantages of primitive-based and volumetric representations to deliver top-tier rendering quality and efficiency. Despite these advancements, the method tends to generate excessive redundant noisy Gaussians overfitted to every training view, which degrades the rendering quality. Additionally, while 3D Gaussian Splatting excels in small-scale and object-centric scenes, its application to larger scenes is hindered by constraints such as limited video memory, excessive optimization duration, and variable appearance across views. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFocus, an innovative approach that incorporates a patch attention algorithm to refine rendering quality and implements a Gaussian constraints strategy to minimize redundancy. Moreover, we propose a subdivision reconstruction strategy for large-scale scenes, dividing them into smaller, manageable blocks for individual training. Our results indicate that GaussianFocus significantly reduces unnecessary Gaussians and enhances rendering quality, surpassing existing State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to effectively manage and render large scenes, such as urban environments, whilst maintaining high fidelity in the visual output.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17798](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17798) |

| 376 | LAYOUTDREAMER: Physics-guided Layout for Text-to-3D Compositional Scene Generation | Yang Zhou,Zongjin He,Qixuan Li,Chao Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, the field of text-guided 3D scene generation has garnered significant attention. High-quality generation that aligns with physical realism and high controllability is crucial for practical 3D scene applications. However, existing methods face fundamental limitations: (i) difficulty capturing complex relationships between multiple objects described in the text, (ii) inability to generate physically plausible scene layouts, and (iii) lack of controllability and extensibility in compositional scenes. In this paper, we introduce LayoutDreamer, a framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to facilitate high-quality, physically consistent compositional scene generation guided by text. Specifically, given a text prompt, we convert it into a directed scene graph and adaptively adjust the density and layout of the initial compositional 3D Gaussians. Subsequently, dynamic camera adjustments are made based on the training focal point to ensure entity-level generation quality. Finally, by extracting directed dependencies from the scene graph, we tailor physical and layout energy to ensure both realism and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LayoutDreamer outperforms other compositional scene generation quality and semantic alignment methods. Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the multiple objects generation metric of T3Bench.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01949](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01949) |
| 375 | GS-LTS: 3D Gaussian Splatting-Based Adaptive Modeling for Long-Term Service Robots | Bin Fu,Jialin Li,Bin Zhang,Ruiping Wang,Xilin Chen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention in robotics for its explicit, high fidelity dense scene representation, demonstrating strong potential for robotic applications. However, 3DGS-based methods in robotics primarily focus on static scenes, with limited attention to the dynamic scene changes essential for long-term service robots. These robots demand sustained task execution and efficient scene updates-challenges current approaches fail to meet. To address these limitations, we propose GS-LTS (Gaussian Splatting for Long-Term Service), a 3DGS-based system enabling indoor robots to manage diverse tasks in dynamic environments over time. GS-LTS detects scene changes (e.g., object addition or removal) via single-image change detection, employs a rule-based policy to autonomously collect multi-view observations, and efficiently updates the scene representation through Gaussian editing. Additionally, we propose a simulation-based benchmark that automatically generates scene change data as compact configuration scripts, providing a standardized, user-friendly evaluation benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate GS-LTS's advantages in reconstruction, navigation, and superior scene updates-faster and higher quality than the image training baseline-advancing 3DGS for long-term robotic operations.

| 374 | StreamGS: Online Generalizable Gaussian Splatting Reconstruction for Unposed Image Streams | Yang LI,Jinglu Wang,Lei Chu,Xiao Li,Shiu-hong Kao,Ying-Cong Chen,Yan Lu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. With the growing interest of interactive applications that need immediate feedback, online 3DGS reconstruction in real-time is in high demand. However, none of existing methods yet meet the demand due to three main challenges: the absence of predetermined camera parameters, the need for generalizable 3DGS optimization, and the necessity of reducing redundancy. We propose StreamGS, an online generalizable 3DGS reconstruction method for unposed image streams, which progressively transform image streams to 3D Gaussian streams by predicting and aggregating per-frame Gaussians. Our method overcomes the limitation of the initial point reconstruction \\cite{dust3r} in tackling out-of-domain (OOD) issues by introducing a content adaptive refinement. The refinement enhances cross-frame consistency by establishing reliable pixel correspondences between adjacent frames. Such correspondences further aid in merging redundant Gaussians through cross-frame feature aggregation. The density of Gaussians is thereby reduced, empowering online reconstruction by significantly lowering computational and memory costs. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets have demonstrated that StreamGS achieves quality on par with optimization-based approaches but does so 150 times faster, and exhibits superior generalizability in handling OOD scenes.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06235](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06235) |

This data offers significant potential for high-quality novel view synthesis, which is crucial for applications such as autonomous vehicle simulators. However, inherent challenges in multi-traversal data often result in suboptimal reconstruction quality, including variations in appearance and the presence of dynamic objects. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Traversal Gaussian Splatting (MTGS), a novel approach that reconstructs high-quality driving scenes from arbitrarily collected multi-traversal data by modeling a shared static geometry while separately handling dynamic elements and appearance variations. Our method employs a multi-traversal dynamic scene graph with a shared static node and traversal-specific dynamic nodes, complemented by color correction nodes with learnable spherical harmonics coefficient residuals. This approach enables high-fidelity novel view synthesis and provides flexibility to navigate any viewpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale driving dataset, nuPlan, with multi-traversal data. Our results demonstrate that MTGS improves LPIPS by 23.5% and geometry accuracy by 46.3% compared to single-traversal baselines. The code and data would be available to the public.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12552](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12552) |
| 372 | Is there anything left? Measuring semantic residuals of objects removed from 3D Gaussian Splatting | Simona Kocour,Assia Benbihi,Aikaterini Adam,Torsten Sattler | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Searching in and editing 3D scenes has become extremely intuitive with trainable scene representations that allow linking human concepts to elements in the scene. These operations are often evaluated on the basis of how accurately the searched element is segmented or extracted from the scene. In this paper, we address the inverse problem, that is, how much of the searched element remains in the scene after it is removed. This question is particularly important in the context of privacy-preserving mapping when a user reconstructs a 3D scene and wants to remove private elements before sharing the map. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address this question. To answer this, we propose a quantitative evaluation that measures whether a removal operation leaves object residuals that can be reasoned over. The scene is not private when such residuals are present. Experiments on state-of-the-art scene representations show that the proposed metrics are meaningful and consistent with the user study that we also present. We also propose a method to refine the removal based on spatial and semantic consistency.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17574](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17574) |
| 371 | GoDe: Gaussians on Demand for Progressive Level of Detail and Scalable Compression | Francesco Di Sario,Riccardo Renzulli,Marco Grangetto,Akihiro Sugimoto,Enzo Tartaglione | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting enhances real-time performance in novel view synthesis by representing scenes with mixtures of Gaussians and utilizing differentiable rasterization. However, it typically requires large storage capacity and high VRAM, demanding the design of effective pruning and compression techniques. Existing methods, while effective in some scenarios, struggle with scalability and fail to adapt models based on critical factors such as computing capabilities or bandwidth, requiring to re-train the model under different configurations. In this work, we propose a novel, model-agnostic technique that organizes Gaussians into several hierarchical layers, enabling progressive Level of Detail (LoD) strategy. This method, combined with recent approach of compression of 3DGS, allows a single model to instantly scale across several compression ratios, with minimal to none impact to quality compared to a single non-scalable model and without requiring re-training. We validate our approach on typical datasets and benchmarks, showcasing low distortion and substantial gains in terms of scalability and adaptability.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13558](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13558) |

Although its success, managing an accurate and lightweight representation of the environment still poses challenges. Both classic and NeRF-based solutions have to trade off accuracy over memory and processing times. In this work, we build on recent advancements in Gaussian Splatting methods to develop a novel LiDAR odometry and mapping pipeline that exclusively relies on Gaussian primitives for its scene representation. Leveraging spherical projection, we drive the refinement of the primitives uniquely from LiDAR measurements. Experiments show that our approach matches the current registration performance, while achieving SOTA results for mapping tasks with minimal GPU requirements. This efficiency makes it a strong candidate for further exploration and potential adoption in real-time robotics estimation tasks.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17491](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17491) |
| 369 | SOUS VIDE: Cooking Visual Drone Navigation Policies in a Gaussian Splatting Vacuum | JunEn Low,Maximilian Adang,Javier Yu,Keiko Nagami,Mac Schwager | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose a new simulator, training approach, and policy architecture, collectively called SOUS VIDE, for end-to-end visual drone navigation. Our trained policies exhibit zero-shot sim-to-real transfer with robust real-world performance using only onboard perception and computation. Our simulator, called FiGS, couples a computationally simple drone dynamics model with a high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting scene reconstruction. FiGS can quickly simulate drone flights producing photorealistic images at up to 130 fps. We use FiGS to collect 100k-300k image/state-action pairs from an expert MPC with privileged state and dynamics information, randomized over dynamics parameters and spatial disturbances. We then distill this expert MPC into an end-to-end visuomotor policy with a lightweight neural architecture, called SV-Net. SV-Net processes color image, optical flow and IMU data streams into low-level thrust and body rate commands at 20 Hz onboard a drone. Crucially, SV-Net includes a learned module for low-level control that adapts at runtime to variations in drone dynamics. In a campaign of 105 hardware experiments, we show SOUS VIDE policies to be robust to 30% mass variations, 40 m/s wind gusts, 60% changes in ambient brightness, shifting or removing objects from the scene, and people moving aggressively through the drone's visual field.

But understanding physical properties like mass, friction, and hardness, in the wild, remains challenging. We propose a new method that reconstructs 3D objects using the Gaussian splatting representation and predicts various physical properties in a zero-shot manner. We propose two techniques during the reconstruction phase: a geometry-aware regularization loss function to improve the shape quality and a region-aware feature contrastive loss function to promote region affinity. Two other new techniques are designed during inference: a feature-based property propagation module and a volume integration module tailored for the Gaussian representation. Our framework is named as zero-shot physical understanding with Gaussian splatting, or PUGS. PUGS achieves new state-of-the-art results on the standard benchmark of ABO-500 mass prediction.

Despite advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for lifelike avatar creation, existing methods struggle with fine-grained control of facial expressions and body movements in full-body talking tasks. Additionally, they often lack sufficient details and cannot run in real-time on mobile devices. We present TaoAvatar, a high-fidelity, lightweight, 3DGS-based full-body talking avatar driven by various signals. Our approach starts by creating a personalized clothed human parametric template that binds Gaussians to represent appearances. We then pre-train a StyleUnet-based network to handle complex pose-dependent non-rigid deformation, which can capture high-frequency appearance details but is too resource-intensive for mobile devices. To overcome this, we "bake" the non-rigid deformations into a lightweight MLP-based network using a distillation technique and develop blend shapes to compensate for details. Extensive experiments show that TaoAvatar achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while running in real-time across various devices, maintaining 90 FPS on high-definition stereo devices such as the Apple Vision Pro.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17032](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17032) |
| 366 | UrbanGS: Semantic-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Urban Scene Reconstruction | Ziwen Li,Jiaxin Huang,Runnan Chen,Yunlong Che,Yandong Guo,Tongliang Liu,Fakhri Karray,Mingming Gong | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing urban scenes is challenging due to their complex geometries and the presence of potentially dynamic objects. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based methods have shown strong performance, but existing approaches often incorporate manual 3D annotations to improve dynamic object modeling, which is impractical due to high labeling costs. Some methods leverage 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) to represent the entire scene, but they treat static and dynamic objects uniformly, leading to unnecessary updates for static elements and ultimately degrading reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose UrbanGS, which leverages 2D semantic maps and an existing dynamic Gaussian approach to distinguish static objects from the scene, enabling separate processing of definite static and potentially dynamic elements. Specifically, for definite static regions, we enforce global consistency to prevent unintended changes in dynamic Gaussian and introduce a K-nearest neighbor (KNN)-based regularization to improve local coherence on low-textured ground surfaces. Notably, for potentially dynamic objects, we aggregate temporal information using learnable time embeddings, allowing each Gaussian to model deformations over time. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality and efficiency, accurately preserving static content while capturing dynamic elements.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03473](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03473) |

However, current streaming approaches face challenges of high per-frame reconstruction time (10s+) and error accumulation, limiting their broader application. In this paper, we propose Instant Gaussian Stream (IGS), a fast and generalizable streaming framework, to address these issues. First, we introduce a generalized Anchor-driven Gaussian Motion Network, which projects multi-view 2D motion features into 3D space, using anchor points to drive the motion of all Gaussians. This generalized Network generates the motion of Gaussians for each target frame in the time required for a single inference. Second, we propose a Key-frame-guided Streaming Strategy that refines each key frame, enabling accurate reconstruction of temporally complex scenes while mitigating error accumulation. We conducted extensive in-domain and cross-domain evaluations, demonstrating that our approach can achieve streaming with a average per-frame reconstruction time of 2s+, alongside a enhancement in view synthesis quality.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16979](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16979) |

Recent advances in radiance field methods have achieved remarkable rendering quality, providing a new avenue for 3D reconstruction from drone imagery. However, dynamic distractors in wild environments challenge the static scene assumption in radiance fields, while limited view constraints hinder the accurate capture of underlying scene geometry. To address these challenges, we introduce DroneSplat, a novel framework designed for robust 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild drone imagery. Our method adaptively adjusts masking thresholds by integrating local-global segmentation heuristics with statistical approaches, enabling precise identification and elimination of dynamic distractors in static scenes. We enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting with multi-view stereo predictions and a voxel-guided optimization strategy, supporting high-quality rendering under limited view constraints.

| 363 | Optimized Minimal 3D Gaussian Splatting | Joo Chan Lee,Jong Hwan Ko,Eunbyung Park | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for real-time, high-performance rendering, enabling a wide range of applications. However, representing 3D scenes with numerous explicit Gaussian primitives imposes significant storage and memory overhead. Recent studies have shown that high-quality rendering can be achieved with a substantially reduced number of Gaussians when represented with high-precision attributes. Nevertheless, existing 3DGS compression methods still rely on a relatively large number of Gaussians, focusing primarily on attribute compression. This is because a smaller set of Gaussians becomes increasingly sensitive to lossy attribute compression, leading to severe quality degradation. Since the number of Gaussians is directly tied to computational costs, it is essential to reduce the number of Gaussians effectively rather than only optimizing storage. In this paper, we propose Optimized Minimal Gaussians representation (OMG), which significantly reduces storage while using a minimal number of primitives. First, we determine the distinct Gaussian from the near ones, minimizing redundancy without sacrificing quality. Second, we propose a compact and precise attribute representation that efficiently captures both continuity and irregularity among primitives. Additionally, we propose a sub-vector quantization technique for improved irregularity representation, maintaining fast training with a negligible codebook size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMG reduces storage requirements by nearly 50% compared to the previous state-of-the-art and enables 600+ FPS rendering while maintaining high rendering quality.

| 362 | Aquatic-GS: A Hybrid 3D Representation for Underwater Scenes | Shaohua Liu,Junzhe Lu,Zuoya Gu,Jiajun Li,Yue Deng | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Representing underwater 3D scenes is a valuable yet complex task, as attenuation and scattering effects during underwater imaging significantly couple the information of the objects and the water. This coupling presents a significant challenge for existing methods in effectively representing both the objects and the water medium simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose Aquatic-GS, a hybrid 3D representation approach for underwater scenes that effectively represents both the objects and the water medium. Specifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the water parameters, while extending the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to model the objects explicitly. Both components are integrated through a physics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater scenes. Moreover, to construct more precise scene geometry and details, we design a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map as auxiliary guidance. After optimization, Aquatic-GS enables the rendering of novel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of underwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that Aquatic-GS surpasses state-of-the-art underwater 3D representation methods, achieving better rendering quality and real-time rendering performance with a 410x increase in speed. Furthermore, regarding underwater image restoration, Aquatic-GS outperforms representative dewatering methods in color correction, detail recovery, and stability.

As 3DGS is becoming a foundational component of many models, any improvement on 3DGS itself can bring huge benefits. To this end, we aim to improve the fundamental paradigm and formulation of 3DGS. We argue that as an unnormalized mixture model, it needs to be neither Gaussians nor splatting. We subsequently propose a new mixture model consisting of flexible Student's t distributions, with both positive (splatting) and negative (scooping) densities. We name our model Student Splatting and Scooping, or SSS. When providing better expressivity, SSS also poses new challenges in learning. Therefore, we also propose a new principled sampling approach for optimization. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, across multiple datasets, settings, and metrics, we demonstrate that SSS outperforms existing methods in terms of quality and parameter efficiency, e.g. achieving matching or better quality with similar numbers of components, and obtaining comparable results while reducing the component number by as much as 82%.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10148](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10148) |

However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01846](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01846) |

Instead of removing dynamic objects as distractors and reconstructing only static environments, this paper proposes an efficient architecture that incrementally tracks camera poses and establishes the 4D Gaussian radiance fields in unknown scenarios by using a sequence of RGB-D images. First, by generating motion masks, we obtain static and dynamic priors for each pixel. To eliminate the influence of static scenes and improve the efficiency on learning the motion of dynamic objects, we classify the Gaussian primitives into static and dynamic Gaussian sets, while the sparse control points along with an MLP is utilized to model the transformation fields of the dynamic Gaussians. To more accurately learn the motion of dynamic Gaussians, a novel 2D optical flow map reconstruction algorithm is designed to render optical flows of dynamic objects between neighbor images, which are further used to supervise the 4D Gaussian radiance fields along with traditional photometric and geometric constraints. In experiments, qualitative and quantitative evaluation results show that the proposed method achieves robust tracking and high-quality view synthesis performance in real-world environments.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16710](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16710) |

| 356 | 1000+ FPS 4D Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene Rendering | Yuheng Yuan,Qiuhong Shen,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has recently gained considerable attention as a method for reconstructing dynamic scenes. Despite achieving superior quality, 4DGS typically requires substantial storage and suffers from slow rendering speed. In this work, we delve into these issues and identify two key sources of temporal redundancy. (Q1) \\textbf{Short-Lifespan Gaussians}: 4DGS uses a large portion of Gaussians with short temporal span to represent scene dynamics, leading to an excessive number of Gaussians. (Q2) \\textbf{Inactive Gaussians}: When rendering, only a small subset of Gaussians contributes to each frame. Despite this, all Gaussians are processed during rasterization, resulting in redundant computation overhead. To address these redundancies, we present \\textbf{4DGS-1K}, which runs at over 1000 FPS on modern GPUs. For Q1, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Variation Score, a new pruning criterion that effectively removes short-lifespan Gaussians while encouraging 4DGS to capture scene dynamics using Gaussians with longer temporal spans. For Q2, we store a mask for active Gaussians across consecutive frames, significantly reducing redundant computations in rendering. Compared to vanilla 4DGS, our method achieves a $41\\times$ reduction in storage and $9\\times$ faster rasterization speed on complex dynamic scenes, while maintaining comparable visual quality.

By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques with foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering feature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of knowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works on feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional features for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss between distilled features and foundation model features. To address these challenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and Gaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To validate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature similarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to highlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach encompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language models (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models (LMMs/LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate real-world applicability, we deploy M3's feature field in indoor scenes on a quadruped robot. Notably, we claim that M3 is the first work to address the core compression challenges in 3D feature distillation.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16413](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16413) |
| 354 | Gaussian Graph Network: Learning Efficient and Generalizable Gaussian Representations from Multi-view Images | Shengjun Zhang,Xin Fei,Fangfu Liu,Haixu Song,Yueqi Duan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis performance. While conventional methods require per-scene optimization, more recently several feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate pixel-aligned Gaussian representations with a learnable network, which are generalizable to different scenes. However, these methods simply combine pixel-aligned Gaussians from multiple views as scene representations, thereby leading to artifacts and extra memory cost without fully capturing the relations of Gaussians from different images. In this paper, we propose Gaussian Graph Network (GGN) to generate efficient and generalizable Gaussian representations. Specifically, we construct Gaussian Graphs to model the relations of Gaussian groups from different views. To support message passing at Gaussian level, we reformulate the basic graph operations over Gaussian representations, enabling each Gaussian to benefit from its connected Gaussian groups with Gaussian feature fusion. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian pooling layer to aggregate various Gaussian groups for efficient representations. We conduct experiments on the large-scale RealEstate10K and ACID datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our model uses fewer Gaussians and achieves better image quality with higher rendering speed.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16338](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16338) |
| 353 | OccluGaussian: Occlusion-Aware Gaussian Splatting for Large Scene Reconstruction and Rendering | Shiyong Liu,Xiao Tang,Zhihao Li,Yingfan He,Chongjie Ye,Jianzhuang Liu,Binxiao Huang,Shunbo Zhou,Xiaofei Wu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In large-scale scene reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting, it is common to partition the scene into multiple smaller regions and reconstruct them individually. However, existing division methods are occlusion-agnostic, meaning that each region may contain areas with severe occlusions. As a result, the cameras within those regions are less correlated, leading to a low average contribution to the overall reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an occlusion-aware scene division strategy that clusters training cameras based on their positions and co-visibilities to acquire multiple regions. Cameras in such regions exhibit stronger correlations and a higher average contribution, facilitating high-quality scene reconstruction. We further propose a region-based rendering technique to accelerate large scene rendering, which culls Gaussians invisible to the region where the viewpoint is located. Such a technique significantly speeds up the rendering without compromising quality. Extensive experiments on multiple large scenes show that our method achieves superior reconstruction results with faster rendering speed compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

To address these challenges, we explore the use of novel view synthesis techniques, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which enables the compact encoding of both 3D geometry and scene appearance. We propose a two-stage procedure that integrates dense and robust keypoint descriptors from the lightweight XFeat feature extractor into 3DGS, enhancing performance in both indoor and outdoor environments. The coarse pose estimates are directly obtained via 2D-3D correspondences between the 3DGS representation and query image descriptors. In the second stage, the initial pose estimate is refined by minimizing the rendering-based photometric warp loss. Benchmarking on widely used indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrates improvements over recent neural rendering-based localization methods, such as NeRFMatch and PNeRFLoc.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16502](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16502) |

We propose a novel label-free, pose-agnostic change detection method that integrates information from multiple viewpoints to construct a change-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation of the scene. With as few as 5 images of the post-change scene, our approach can learn an additional change channel in a 3DGS and produce change masks that outperform single-view techniques. Our change-aware 3D scene representation additionally enables the generation of accurate change masks for unseen viewpoints. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in complex multi-object scenes, achieving a 1.7x and 1.5x improvement in Mean Intersection Over Union and F1 score respectively over other baselines. We also contribute a new real-world dataset to benchmark change detection in diverse challenging scenes in the presence of lighting variations.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03911](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03911) |
| 350 | Enhancing Close-up Novel View Synthesis via Pseudo-labeling | Jiatong Xia,Libo Sun,Lingqiao Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent methods, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in novel view synthesis. However, despite their success in producing high-quality images for viewpoints similar to those seen during training, they struggle when generating detailed images from viewpoints that significantly deviate from the training set, particularly in close-up views. The primary challenge stems from the lack of specific training data for close-up views, leading to the inability of current methods to render these views accurately. To address this issue, we introduce a novel pseudo-label-based learning strategy. This approach leverages pseudo-labels derived from existing training data to provide targeted supervision across a wide range of close-up viewpoints. Recognizing the absence of benchmarks for this specific challenge, we also present a new dataset designed to assess the effectiveness of both current and future methods in this area. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15908](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15908) |

However, these systems often encounter incomplete reconstructions in complex indoor environments, characterized by substantial holes due to unobserved geometry caused by obstacles or limited view angles. To address this challenge, we present Manhattan Gaussian SLAM, an RGB-D system that leverages the Manhattan World hypothesis to enhance geometric accuracy and completeness. By seamlessly integrating fused line segments derived from structured scenes, our method ensures robust tracking in textureless indoor areas. Moreover, The extracted lines and planar surface assumption allow strategic interpolation of new Gaussians in regions of missing geometry, enabling efficient scene completion.

To generate diverse camera poses and unbounded spatial extent of real-world scenes, while ensuring generalization to arbitrary text prompts, previous methods fine-tune 2D generative models to jointly model camera poses and multi-view images. However, these methods suffer from instability when extending 2D generative models to joint modeling due to the modality gap, which necessitates additional models to stabilize training and inference. In this work, we propose an architecture and a sampling strategy to jointly model multi-view images and camera poses when fine-tuning a video generation model. Our core idea is a dual-stream architecture that attaches a dedicated pose generation model alongside a pre-trained video generation model via communication blocks, generating multi-view images and camera poses through separate streams. This design reduces interference between the pose and image modalities. Additionally, we propose an asynchronous sampling strategy that denoises camera poses faster than multi-view images, allowing rapidly denoised poses to condition multi-view generation, reducing mutual ambiguity and enhancing cross-modal consistency. Trained on multiple large-scale real-world datasets (RealEstate10K, MVImgNet, DL3DV-10K, ACID), VideoRFSplat outperforms existing text-to-3D direct generation methods that heavily depend on post-hoc refinement via score distillation sampling, achieving superior results without such refinement.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15855](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15855) |
| 347 | BARD-GS: Blur-Aware Reconstruction of Dynamic Scenes via Gaussian Splatting | Yiren Lu,Yunlai Zhou,Disheng Liu,Tuo Liang,Yu Yin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown remarkable potential for static scene reconstruction, and recent advancements have extended its application to dynamic scenes. However, the quality of reconstructions depends heavily on high-quality input images and precise camera poses, which are not that trivial to fulfill in real-world scenarios. Capturing dynamic scenes with handheld monocular cameras, for instance, typically involves simultaneous movement of both the camera and objects within a single exposure. This combined motion frequently results in image blur that existing methods cannot adequately handle. To address these challenges, we introduce BARD-GS, a novel approach for robust dynamic scene reconstruction that effectively handles blurry inputs and imprecise camera poses. Our method comprises two main components: 1) camera motion deblurring and 2) object motion deblurring. By explicitly decomposing motion blur into camera motion blur and object motion blur and modeling them separately, we achieve significantly improved rendering results in dynamic regions. In addition, we collect a real-world motion blur dataset of dynamic scenes to evaluate our approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BARD-GS effectively reconstructs high-quality dynamic scenes under realistic conditions, significantly outperforming existing methods.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15835](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15835) |
| 346 | GaussRender: Learning 3D Occupancy with Gaussian Rendering | Lo\xc3\xafck Chambon,Eloi Zablocki,Alexandre Boulch,Micka\xc3\xabl Chen,Matthieu Cord | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Understanding the 3D geometry and semantics of driving scenes is critical for safe autonomous driving. Recent advances in 3D occupancy prediction have improved scene representation but often suffer from spatial inconsistencies, leading to floating artifacts and poor surface localization. Existing voxel-wise losses (e.g., cross-entropy) fail to enforce geometric coherence. In this paper, we propose GaussRender, a module that improves 3D occupancy learning by enforcing projective consistency. Our key idea is to project both predicted and ground-truth 3D occupancy into 2D camera views, where we apply supervision. Our method penalizes 3D configurations that produce inconsistent 2D projections, thereby enforcing a more coherent 3D structure. To achieve this efficiently, we leverage differentiable rendering with Gaussian splatting. GaussRender seamlessly integrates with existing architectures while maintaining efficiency and requiring no inference-time modifications. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks (SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, SSCBench-KITTI360) demonstrate that GaussRender significantly improves geometric fidelity across various 3D occupancy models (TPVFormer, SurroundOcc, Symphonies), achieving state-of-the-art results, particularly on surface-sensitive metrics.

| 345 | Mitigating Ambiguities in 3D Classification with Gaussian Splatting | Ruiqi Zhang,Hao Zhu,Jingyi Zhao,Qi Zhang,Xun Cao,Zhan Ma | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D classification with point cloud input is a fundamental problem in 3D vision. However, due to the discrete nature and the insufficient material description of point cloud representations, there are ambiguities in distinguishing wire-like and flat surfaces, as well as transparent or reflective objects. To address these issues, we propose Gaussian Splatting (GS) point cloud-based 3D classification. We find that the scale and rotation coefficients in the GS point cloud help characterize surface types. Specifically, wire-like surfaces consist of multiple slender Gaussian ellipsoids, while flat surfaces are composed of a few flat Gaussian ellipsoids. Additionally, the opacity in the GS point cloud represents the transparency characteristics of objects. As a result, ambiguities in point cloud-based 3D classification can be mitigated utilizing GS point cloud as input. To verify the effectiveness of GS point cloud input, we construct the first real-world GS point cloud dataset in the community, which includes 20 categories with 200 objects in each category. Experiments not only validate the superiority of GS point cloud input, especially in distinguishing ambiguous objects, but also demonstrate the generalization ability across different classification methods.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08352](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08352) |

While state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods excel at synthesizing photorealistic novel views through rasterization-based rendering, their reliance on sparse, explicit primitives severely limits their ability to recover watertight and topologically consistent 3D surfaces.We introduce MonoGSDF, a novel method that couples Gaussian-based primitives with a neural Signed Distance Field (SDF) for high-quality reconstruction. During training, the SDF guides Gaussians' spatial distribution, while at inference, Gaussians serve as priors to reconstruct surfaces, eliminating the need for memory-intensive Marching Cubes. To handle arbitrary-scale scenes, we propose a scaling strategy for robust generalization. A multi-resolution training scheme further refines details and monocular geometric cues from off-the-shelf estimators enhance reconstruction quality. Experiments on real-world datasets show MonoGSDF outperforms prior methods while maintaining efficiency.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16898](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16898) |

Existing methods often fail to effectively integrate information across different object states, limiting the accuracy of part-mesh reconstruction and part dynamics modeling, particularly for complex multi-part articulated objects. We introduce ArtGS, a novel approach that leverages 3D Gaussians as a flexible and efficient representation to address these issues. Our method incorporates canonical Gaussians with coarse-to-fine initialization and updates for aligning articulated part information across different object states, and employs a skinning-inspired part dynamics modeling module to improve both part-mesh reconstruction and articulation learning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including a new benchmark for complex multi-part objects, demonstrate that ArtGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in joint parameter estimation and part mesh reconstruction.

| 342 | SketchSplat: 3D Edge Reconstruction via Differentiable Multi-view Sketch Splatting | Haiyang Ying,Matthias Zwicker | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Edges are one of the most basic parametric primitives to describe structural information in 3D. In this paper, we study parametric 3D edge reconstruction from calibrated multi-view images. Previous methods usually reconstruct a 3D edge point set from multi-view 2D edge images, and then fit 3D edges to the point set. However, noise in the point set may cause gaps among fitted edges, and the recovered edges may not align with input multi-view images since the edge fitting depends only on the reconstructed 3D point set. To mitigate these problems, we propose SketchSplat, a method to reconstruct accurate, complete, and compact 3D edges via differentiable multi-view sketch splatting. We represent 3D edges as sketches, which are parametric lines and curves defined by attributes including control points, scales, and opacity. During edge reconstruction, we iteratively sample Gaussian points from a set of sketches and rasterize the Gaussians onto 2D edge images. Then the gradient of the image error with respect to the input 2D edge images can be back-propagated to optimize the sketch attributes. Our method bridges 2D edge images and 3D edges in a differentiable manner, which ensures that 3D edges align well with 2D images and leads to accurate and complete results. We also propose a series of adaptive topological operations and apply them along with the sketch optimization. The topological operations help reduce the number of sketches required while ensuring high accuracy, yielding a more compact reconstruction. Finally, we contribute an accurate 2D edge detector that improves the performance of both ours and existing methods. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, completeness, and compactness on a benchmark CAD dataset.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14786](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14786) |
| 341 | HandSplat: Embedding-Driven Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity Hand Rendering | Yilan Dong,Haohe Liu,Qing Wang,Jiahao Yang,Wenqing Wang,Gregory Slabaugh,Shanxin Yuan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods for hand rendering rely on rigid skeletal motion with an oversimplified non-rigid motion model, which fails to capture fine geometric and appearance details. Additionally, they perform densification based solely on per-point gradients and process poses independently, ignoring spatial and temporal correlations. These limitations lead to geometric detail loss, temporal instability, and inefficient point distribution. To address these issues, we propose HandSplat, a novel Gaussian Splatting-based framework that enhances both fidelity and stability for hand rendering. To improve fidelity, we extend standard 3DGS attributes with implicit geometry and appearance embeddings for finer non-rigid motion modeling while preserving the static hand characteristic modeled by original 3DGS attributes. Additionally, we introduce a local gradient-aware densification strategy that dynamically refines Gaussian density in high-variation regions. To improve stability, we incorporate pose-conditioned attribute regularization to encourage attribute consistency across similar poses, mitigating temporal artifacts. Extensive experiments on InterHand2.6M demonstrate that HandSplat surpasses existing methods in fidelity and stability while achieving real-time performance. We will release the code and pre-trained models upon acceptance.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14736](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14736) |

However, existing novel view synthesis methods struggle with temporal coherence and visual fidelity, leading to flickering and inconsistency. To address these challenges, we introduce history-awareness, leveraging previous frames to reconstruct the scene and improve quality and stability. We propose a hybrid splat-voxel feed-forward scene reconstruction approach that combines Gaussian Splatting to propagate information over time, with a hierarchical voxel grid for temporal fusion. Gaussian primitives are efficiently warped over time using a motion graph that extends 2D tracking models to 3D motion, while a sparse voxel transformer integrates new temporal observations in an error-aware manner. Crucially, our method does not require training on multi-view video datasets, which are currently limited in size and diversity, and can be directly applied to sparse-view video streams in a history-aware manner at inference time. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both static and streaming scene reconstruction, effectively reducing temporal artifacts and visual artifacts while running at interactive rates (15 fps with 350ms delay) on a single H100 GPU.

We propose Opti3DGS, a novel frequency-modulated coarse-to-fine optimization framework that aims to minimize the number of Gaussian primitives used to represent a scene, thus reducing memory and storage demands. Opti3DGS leverages image frequency modulation, initially enforcing a coarse scene representation and progressively refining it by modulating frequency details in the training images. On the baseline 3DGS, we demonstrate an average reduction of 62% in Gaussians, a 40% reduction in the training GPU memory requirements and a 20% reduction in optimization time without sacrificing the visual quality. Furthermore, we show that our method integrates seamlessly with many 3DGS-based techniques, consistently reducing the number of Gaussian primitives while maintaining, and often improving, visual quality. Additionally, Opti3DGS inherently produces a level-of-detail scene representation at no extra cost, a natural byproduct of the optimization pipeline.

Stylized worlds can also be used for downstream tasks where there is limited training data and a need to expand a model's training distribution. Most current novel-view synthesis stylization techniques lack the ability to convincingly change geometry. This is because any geometry change requires increased style strength which is often capped for stylization stability and consistency. In this work, we propose a new autoregressive 3D Gaussian Splatting stylization method. As part of this method, we contribute a new RGBD diffusion model that allows for strength control over appearance and shape stylization. To ensure consistency across stylized frames, we use a combination of novel depth-guided cross attention, feature injection, and a Warp ControlNet conditioned on composite frames for guiding the stylization of new frames. We validate our method via extensive qualitative results, quantitative experiments, and a user study.

| 337 | Improving Adaptive Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Glenn Grubert,Florian Barthel,Anna Hilsmann,Peter Eisert | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most influential works in the past year. Due to its efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis capabilities, it has been widely adopted in many research fields and applications. Nevertheless, 3DGS still faces challenges to properly manage the number of Gaussian primitives that are used during scene reconstruction. Following the adaptive density control (ADC) mechanism of 3D Gaussian Splatting, new Gaussians in under-reconstructed regions are created, while Gaussians that do not contribute to the rendering quality are pruned. We observe that those criteria for densifying and pruning Gaussians can sometimes lead to worse rendering by introducing artifacts. We especially observe under-reconstructed background or overfitted foreground regions. To encounter both problems, we propose three new improvements to the adaptive density control mechanism. Those include a correction for the scene extent calculation that does not only rely on camera positions, an exponentially ascending gradient threshold to improve training convergence, and significance-aware pruning strategy to avoid background artifacts. With these adaptions, we show that the rendering quality improves while using the same number of Gaussians primitives. Furthermore, with our improvements, the training converges considerably faster, allowing for more than twice as fast training times while yielding better quality than 3DGS. Finally, our contributions are easily compatible with most existing derivative works of 3DGS making them relevant for future works.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14274](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14274) |
| 336 | RoGSplat: Learning Robust Generalizable Human Gaussian Splatting from Sparse Multi-View Images | Junjin Xiao,Qing Zhang,Yonewei Nie,Lei Zhu,Wei-Shi Zheng | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper presents RoGSplat, a novel approach for synthesizing high-fidelity novel views of unseen human from sparse multi-view images, while requiring no cumbersome per-subject optimization. Unlike previous methods that typically struggle with sparse views with few overlappings and are less effective in reconstructing complex human geometry, the proposed method enables robust reconstruction in such challenging conditions. Our key idea is to lift SMPL vertices to dense and reliable 3D prior points representing accurate human body geometry, and then regress human Gaussian parameters based on the points. To account for possible misalignment between SMPL model and images, we propose to predict image-aligned 3D prior points by leveraging both pixel-level features and voxel-level features, from which we regress the coarse Gaussians. To enhance the ability to capture high-frequency details, we further render depth maps from the coarse 3D Gaussians to help regress fine-grained pixel-wise Gaussians. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis and cross-dataset generalization.

Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we showcase the performance improvements and high reconstruction fidelity attainable with gradient-aware upscaling of 3DGS images.

To address this limitation, we propose 3D-LMVIC, a novel learning-based multi-view image compression framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to derive geometric priors for accurate disparity estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a depth map compression model to minimize geometric redundancy across views, along with a multi-view sequence ordering strategy based on a defined distance measure between views to enhance correlations between adjacent views.

Existing methods rely on direct matching for end-to-end lifting, yielding inferior results; or employ a two-stage solution constrained by complex pre- or post-processing. In this work, we design a new end-to-end object-aware lifting approach, named Unified-Lift that provides accurate 3D segmentation based on the 3D Gaussian representation. To start, we augment each Gaussian point with an additional Gaussian-level feature learned using a contrastive loss to encode instance information. Importantly, we introduce a learnable object-level codebook to account for individual objects in the scene for an explicit object-level understanding and associate the encoded object-level features with the Gaussian-level point features for segmentation predictions. While promising, achieving effective codebook learning is non-trivial and a naive solution leads to degraded performance. Therefore, we formulate the association learning module and the noisy label filtering module for effective and robust codebook learning. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks: LERF-Masked, Replica, and Messy Rooms datasets. Both qualitative and quantitative results manifest that our Unified-Lift clearly outperforms existing methods in terms of segmentation quality and time efficiency.

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention in the field of surface reconstruction due to its impressive geometric quality and computational efficiency. While recent relevant advancements in novel view synthesis under inconsistent illumination using 3DGS have shown promise, the challenge of robust surface reconstruction under such conditions is still being explored. To address this challenge, we propose a method called GS-3I. Specifically, to mitigate 3D Gaussian optimization bias caused by underexposed regions in single-view images, based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a tone mapping correction framework is introduced. Furthermore, inconsistent lighting across multi-view images, resulting from variations in camera settings and complex scene illumination, often leads to geometric constraint mismatches and deviations in the reconstructed surface. To overcome this, we propose a normal compensation mechanism that integrates reference normals extracted from single-view image with normals computed from multi-view observations to effectively constrain geometric inconsistencies. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that GS-3I can achieve robust and accurate surface reconstruction across complex illumination scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and versatility in this critical challenge. https://github.com/TFwang-9527/GS-3I</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12335](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12335) |

To adapt 3DGS for dynamic content, deformable 3DGS incorporates temporally deformable primitives with learnable latent embeddings to capture complex motions. Despite its impressive performance, the high-dimensional embeddings and vast number of primitives lead to substantial storage requirements. In this paper, we introduce a \\textbf{Light}weight \\textbf{4}D\\textbf{GS} framework, called Light4GS, that employs significance pruning with a deep context model to provide a lightweight storage-efficient dynamic 3DGS representation. The proposed Light4GS is based on 4DGS that is a typical representation of deformable 3DGS. Specifically, our framework is built upon two core components: (1) a spatio-temporal significance pruning strategy that eliminates over 64\\% of the deformable primitives, followed by an entropy-constrained spherical harmonics compression applied to the remainder; and (2) a deep context model that integrates intra- and inter-prediction with hyperprior into a coarse-to-fine context structure to enable efficient multiscale latent embedding compression. Our approach achieves over 120x compression and increases rendering FPS up to 20\\% compared to the baseline 4DGS, and also superior to frame-wise state-of-the-art 3DGS compression methods, revealing the effectiveness of our Light4GS in terms of both intra- and inter-prediction methods without sacrificing rendering quality.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13948](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13948) |

In this paper, we introduce InstantSplat, a novel approach for addressing sparse-view 3D scene reconstruction at lightning-fast speed. InstantSplat employs a self-supervised framework that optimizes 3D scene representation and camera poses by unprojecting 2D pixels into 3D space and aligning them using differentiable neural rendering. The optimization process is initialized with a large-scale trained geometric foundation model, which provides dense priors that yield initial points through model inference, after which we further optimize all scene parameters using photometric errors. To mitigate redundancy introduced by the prior model, we propose a co-visibility-based geometry initialization, and a Gaussian-based bundle adjustment is employed to rapidly adapt both the scene representation and camera parameters without relying on a complex adaptive density control process. Overall, InstantSplat is compatible with multiple point-based representations for view synthesis and surface reconstruction. It achieves an acceleration of over 30x in reconstruction and improves visual quality (SSIM) from 0.3755 to 0.7624 compared to traditional SfM with 3D-GS.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20309](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20309) |

We propose a novel Control Barrier Function (CBF) that not only induces safety with respect to all Gaussian primitives in the scene, but when synthesized into a controller, is capable of processing hundreds of thousands of Gaussians while maintaining a minimal memory footprint and operating at 15 Hz during online Splat training. Of the total compute time, a small fraction of it consumes GPU resources, enabling uninterrupted training. The safety layer is minimally invasive, correcting robot actions only when they are unsafe. To showcase the safety filter, we also introduce SplatBridge, an open-source software package built with ROS for real-time GSplat mapping for robots. We demonstrate the safety and robustness of our pipeline first in simulation, where our method is 20-50x faster, safer, and less conservative than competing methods based on neural radiance fields. Further, we demonstrate simultaneous GSplat mapping and safety filtering on a drone hardware platform using only on-board perception. We verify that under teleoperation a human pilot cannot invoke a collision.

However, considering security, capacity, invisibility, and training efficiency, the copyright of 3DGS assets is not well protected as existing watermarking methods are unsuited for its rendering pipeline. In this paper, we propose GuardSplat, an innovative and efficient framework for watermarking 3DGS assets. Specifically, 1) We propose a CLIP-guided pipeline for optimizing the message decoder with minimal costs. The key objective is to achieve high-accuracy extraction by leveraging CLIP's aligning capability and rich representations, demonstrating exceptional capacity and efficiency. 2) We tailor a Spherical-Harmonic-aware (SH-aware) Message Embedding module for 3DGS, seamlessly embedding messages into the SH features of each 3D Gaussian while preserving the original 3D structure. This enables watermarking 3DGS assets with minimal fidelity trade-offs and prevents malicious users from removing the watermarks from the model files, meeting the demands for invisibility and security. 3) We present an Anti-distortion Message Extraction module to improve robustness against various distortions. Experiments demonstrate that GuardSplat outperforms state-of-the-art and achieves fast optimization speed.

| 327 | Generative Gaussian Splatting: Generating 3D Scenes with Video Diffusion Priors | Katja Schwarz,Norman Mueller,Peter Kontschieder | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Synthesizing consistent and photorealistic 3D scenes is an open problem in computer vision. Video diffusion models generate impressive videos but cannot directly synthesize 3D representations, i.e., lack 3D consistency in the generated sequences. In addition, directly training generative 3D models is challenging due to a lack of 3D training data at scale. In this work, we present Generative Gaussian Splatting (GGS) -- a novel approach that integrates a 3D representation with a pre-trained latent video diffusion model. Specifically, our model synthesizes a feature field parameterized via 3D Gaussian primitives. The feature field is then either rendered to feature maps and decoded into multi-view images, or directly upsampled into a 3D radiance field. We evaluate our approach on two common benchmark datasets for scene synthesis, RealEstate10K and ScanNet+, and find that our proposed GGS model significantly improves both the 3D consistency of the generated multi-view images, and the quality of the generated 3D scenes over all relevant baselines. Compared to a similar model without 3D representation, GGS improves FID on the generated 3D scenes by ~20% on both RealEstate10K and ScanNet+.

To tackle this problem, we introduce DeGauss, a simple and robust self-supervised framework for dynamic scene reconstruction based on a decoupled dynamic-static Gaussian Splatting design. DeGauss models dynamic elements with foreground Gaussians and static content with background Gaussians, using a probabilistic mask to coordinate their composition and enable independent yet complementary optimization. DeGauss generalizes robustly across a wide range of real-world scenarios, from casual image collections to long, dynamic egocentric videos, without relying on complex heuristics or extensive supervision. Experiments on benchmarks including NeRF-on-the-go, ADT, AEA, Hot3D, and EPIC-Fields demonstrate that DeGauss consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a strong baseline for generalizable, distractor-free 3D reconstructionin highly dynamic, interaction-rich environments.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13176](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13176) |

In contrast, this work introduces On-the-Fly GS, a progressive framework enabling near real-time 3DGS optimization during image capture. As each image arrives, its pose and sparse points are updated via on-the-fly SfM, and newly optimized Gaussians are immediately integrated into the 3DGS field. We propose a progressive local optimization strategy to prioritize new images and their neighbors by their corresponding overlapping relationship, allowing the new image and its overlapping images to get more training. To further stabilize training across old and new images, an adaptive learning rate schedule balances the iterations and the learning rate. Moreover, to maintain overall quality of the 3DGS field, an efficient global optimization scheme prevents overfitting to the newly added images. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our On-the-Fly GS reduces training time significantly, optimizing each new image in seconds with minimal rendering loss, offering the first practical step toward rapid, progressive 3DGS reconstruction.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13086](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13086) |

Traditional methods often treat the human body and clothing as inseparable, limiting users' ability to freely mix and match garments. In response to this limitation, we present LAyered Gaussian Avatar (LAGA), a carefully designed framework enabling the creation of high-fidelity decomposable avatars with diverse garments. By decoupling garments from avatar, our framework empowers users to conviniently edit avatars at the garment level. Our approach begins by modeling the avatar using a set of Gaussian points organized in a layered structure, where each layer corresponds to a specific garment or the human body itself. To generate high-quality garments for each layer, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy for diverse garment generation and a novel dual-SDS loss function to maintain coherence between the generated garments and avatar components, including the human body and other garments. Moreover, we introduce three regularization losses to guide the movement of Gaussians for garment transfer, allowing garments to be freely transferred to various avatars. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our approach surpasses existing methods in the generation of 3D clothed humans.</details> | May 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12663](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12663) |
| 323 | NeuSG: Neural Implicit Surface Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting Guidance | Hanlin Chen,Chen Li,Yunsong Wang,Gim Hee Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Existing neural implicit surface reconstruction methods have achieved impressive performance in multi-view 3D reconstruction by leveraging explicit geometry priors such as depth maps or point clouds as regularization. However, the reconstruction results still lack fine details because of the over-smoothed depth map or sparse point cloud. In this work, we propose a neural implicit surface reconstruction pipeline with guidance from 3D Gaussian Splatting to recover highly detailed surfaces. The advantage of 3D Gaussian Splatting is that it can generate dense point clouds with detailed structure. Nonetheless, a naive adoption of 3D Gaussian Splatting can fail since the generated points are the centers of 3D Gaussians that do not necessarily lie on the surface. We thus introduce a scale regularizer to pull the centers close to the surface by enforcing the 3D Gaussians to be extremely thin. Moreover, we propose to refine the point cloud from 3D Gaussians Splatting with the normal priors from the surface predicted by neural implicit models instead of using a fixed set of points as guidance. Consequently, the quality of surface reconstruction improves from the guidance of the more accurate 3D Gaussian splatting. By jointly optimizing the 3D Gaussian Splatting and the neural implicit model, our approach benefits from both representations and generates complete surfaces with intricate details. Experiments on Tanks and Temples verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.</details> | December 2023. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00846](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00846) |

The first is to adaptively and explicitly allocate sparse voxels to different levels of detail within scenes, faithfully reproducing scene details with $65536^3$ grid resolution while achieving high rendering frame rates. Second, we customize a rasterizer for efficient adaptive sparse voxels rendering. We render voxels in the correct depth order by using ray direction-dependent Morton ordering, which avoids the well-known popping artifact found in Gaussian splatting. Our method improves the previous neural-free voxel model by over 4db PSNR and more than 10x FPS speedup, achieving state-of-the-art comparable novel-view synthesis results.

However, achieving rate-distortion-optimized compression of 3DGS representations for transmission and/or storage applications remains a challenge. CAT-3DGS introduces a context-adaptive triplane hyperprior for end-to-end optimized compression, delivering state-of-the-art coding performance. Despite this, it requires prolonged training and decoding time. To address these limitations, we propose CAT-3DGS Pro, an enhanced version of CAT-3DGS that improves both compression performance and computational efficiency. First, we introduce a PCA-guided vector-matrix hyperprior, which replaces the triplane-based hyperprior to reduce redundant parameters. To achieve a more balanced rate-distortion trade-off and faster encoding, we propose an alternate optimization strategy (A-RDO). Additionally, we refine the sampling rate optimization method in CAT-3DGS, leading to significant improvements in rate-distortion performance. These enhancements result in a 46.6% BD-rate reduction and 3x speedup in training time on BungeeNeRF, while achieving 5x acceleration in decoding speed for the Amsterdam scene compared to CAT-3DGS.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12862](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12862) |

While previous studies have leveraged visual perception to estimate spatial acoustics, the combined use of surface normal and structural details from 3D representations in acoustic modeling has been underexplored. Given their direct impact on sound wave reflections and propagation, surface normals should be jointly modeled with structural details to achieve accurate spatial acoustics. In this paper, we propose a surface-enhanced geometry-aware approach for NVAS to improve spatial acoustic modeling. To achieve this, we exploit geometric priors, such as image, depth map, surface normals, and point clouds obtained using a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based framework. We introduce a dual cross-attention-based transformer integrating geometrical constraints into frequency query to understand the surroundings of the emitter. Additionally, we design a ConvNeXt-based spectral features processing network called Spectral Refinement Network (SRN) to synthesize realistic binaural audio.

Existing methods have proposed NeRF-based implicit models to exploit visual cues as a condition for synthesizing binaural audio. However, in addition to low efficiency originating from heavy NeRF rendering, these methods all have a limited ability of characterizing the entire scene environment such as room geometry, material properties, and the spatial relation between the listener and sound source. To address these issues, we propose a novel Audio-Visual Gaussian Splatting (AV-GS) model. To obtain a material-aware and geometry-aware condition for audio synthesis, we learn an explicit point-based scene representation with an audio-guidance parameter on locally initialized Gaussian points, taking into account the space relation from the listener and sound source. To make the visual scene model audio adaptive, we propose a point densification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the Gaussian points, with the per-point contribution in sound propagation (e.g., more points needed for texture-less wall surfaces as they affect sound path diversion). Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our AV-GS over existing alternatives on the real-world RWAS and simulation-based SoundSpaces datasets.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08920](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08920) |

However, they exhibit poor performance when confronted with sparse inputs, primarily due to the sparse distribution of Gaussian points and insufficient view supervision. To relieve these challenges, we propose SPC-GS, leveraging Scene-layout-based Gaussian Initialization (SGI) and Semantic-Prompt Consistency (SPC) Regularization for open-world free view synthesis with sparse inputs. Specifically, SGI provides a dense, scene-layout-based Gaussian distribution by utilizing view-changed images generated from the video generation model and view-constraint Gaussian points densification. Additionally, SPC mitigates limited view supervision by employing semantic-prompt-based consistency constraints developed by SAM2. This approach leverages available semantics from training views, serving as instructive prompts, to optimize visually overlapping regions in novel views with 2D and 3D consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SPC-GS across Replica and ScanNet benchmarks. Notably, our SPC-GS achieves a 3.06 dB gain in PSNR for reconstruction quality and a 7.3% improvement in mIoU for open-world semantic segmentation.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12535](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12535) |

However, substantial data size poses challenges for storage and transmission, making 3D GS compression an essential technology. Current 3D GS compression research primarily focuses on developing more compact scene representations, such as converting explicit 3D GS data into implicit forms. In contrast, compression of the GS data itself has hardly been explored. To address this gap, we propose a Hierarchical GS Compression (HGSC) technique. Initially, we prune unimportant Gaussians based on importance scores derived from both global and local significance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining visual quality. An Octree structure is used to compress 3D positions. Based on the 3D GS Octree, we implement a hierarchical attribute compression strategy by employing a KD-tree to partition the 3D GS into multiple blocks. We apply farthest point sampling to select anchor primitives within each block and others as non-anchor primitives with varying Levels of Details (LoDs). Anchor primitives serve as reference points for predicting non-anchor primitives across different LoDs to reduce spatial redundancy. For anchor primitives, we use the region adaptive hierarchical transform to achieve near-lossless compression of various attributes. For non-anchor primitives, each is predicted based on the k-nearest anchor primitives. To further minimize prediction errors, the reconstructed LoD and anchor primitives are combined to form new anchor primitives to predict the next LoD. Our method notably achieves superior compression quality and a significant data size reduction of over 4.5 times compared to the state-of-the-art compression method on small scenes datasets.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06976](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06976) |

In contrast to navigation in discrete environments with predefined trajectories, VLN in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents greater challenges, as the agent is free to navigate any unobstructed location and is more vulnerable to visual occlusions or blind spots. Recent approaches have attempted to address this by imagining future environments, either through predicted future visual images or semantic features, rather than relying solely on current observations. However, these RGB-based and feature-based methods lack intuitive appearance-level information or high-level semantic complexity crucial for effective navigation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable 3DGS-based pre-training paradigm, called UnitedVLN, which enables agents to better explore future environments by unitedly rendering high-fidelity 360 visual images and semantic features. UnitedVLN employs two key schemes: search-then-query sampling and separate-then-united rendering, which facilitate efficient exploitation of neural primitives, helping to integrate both appearance and semantic information for more robust navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnitedVLN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on existing VLN-CE benchmarks.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16053](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16053) |

Traditional mesh-based approaches require tedious and error-prone mesh filling and fixing process, while typically output rough boundary surface. Our pipeline combines Gaussian Splatting with a novel, versatile particle-based differentiable simulator that simultaneously accommodates constitutive model, actuator, and collision, without interference with mesh. Based on the gradients from this simulator, we provide flexible choice of topology representation for optimization, including particle, neural implicit surface, and quadratic surface. The resultant pipeline takes easily accessible photos and videos as input and outputs the topology that matches the physical characteristics of the input. We demonstrate the efficacy of our pipeline on a synthetic dataset and four real-world tasks with 3D-printed prototypes. Compared with existing mesh-based method, our pipeline is 5.26x faster on average with improved shape quality. These results highlight the potential of our pipeline in 3D vision, soft robotics, and manufacturing applications.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12343) |
| 311 | Swift4D:Adaptive divide-and-conquer Gaussian Splatting for compact and efficient reconstruction of dynamic scene | Jiahao Wu,Rui Peng,Zhiyan Wang,Lu Xiao,Luyang Tang,Jinbo Yan,Kaiqiang Xiong,Ronggang Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis has long been a practical but challenging task, although the introduction of numerous methods to solve this problem, even combining advanced representations like 3D Gaussian Splatting, they still struggle to recover high-quality results and often consume too much storage memory and training time. In this paper we propose Swift4D, a divide-and-conquer 3D Gaussian Splatting method that can handle static and dynamic primitives separately, achieving a good trade-off between rendering quality and efficiency, motivated by the fact that most of the scene is the static primitive and does not require additional dynamic properties. Concretely, we focus on modeling dynamic transformations only for the dynamic primitives which benefits both efficiency and quality. We first employ a learnable decomposition strategy to separate the primitives, which relies on an additional parameter to classify primitives as static or dynamic. For the dynamic primitives, we employ a compact multi-resolution 4D Hash mapper to transform these primitives from canonical space into deformation space at each timestamp, and then mix the static and dynamic primitives to produce the final output. This divide-and-conquer method facilitates efficient training and reduces storage redundancy. Our method not only achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while being 20X faster in training than previous SOTA methods with a minimum storage requirement of only 30MB on real-world datasets.

GS represents 3D scenes using Gaussian components with trainable color and opacity. This representation achieves high-quality renderings with fast inference. Regrettably, it is challenging to integrate such a solution with varying light conditions, including shadows and light reflections, manual adjustments, and a physical engine. Recently, a few approaches have appeared that incorporate ray-tracing or mesh primitives into GS to address some of these caveats. However, no such solution can simultaneously solve all the existing limitations of the classical GS. Consequently, we introduce REdiSplats, which employs ray tracing and a mesh-based representation of flat 3D Gaussians. In practice, we model the scene using flat Gaussian distributions parameterized by the mesh. We can leverage fast ray tracing and control Gaussian modification by adjusting the mesh vertices. Moreover, REdiSplats allows modeling of light conditions, manual adjustments, and physical simulation. Furthermore, we can render our models using 3D tools such as Blender or Nvdiffrast, which opens the possibility of integrating them with all existing 3D graphics techniques dedicated to mesh representations.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12284](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12284) |

Salcudean,Yueming Jin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Real2Sim is becoming increasingly important with the rapid development of surgical artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomy. In this work, we propose a novel Real2Sim methodology, Instrument-Splatting, that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to provide fully controllable 3D reconstruction of surgical instruments from monocular surgical videos. To maintain both high visual fidelity and manipulability, we introduce a geometry pre-training to bind Gaussian point clouds on part mesh with accurate geometric priors and define a forward kinematics to control the Gaussians as flexible as real instruments. Afterward, to handle unposed videos, we design a novel instrument pose tracking method leveraging semantics-embedded Gaussians to robustly refine per-frame instrument poses and joint states in a render-and-compare manner, which allows our instrument Gaussian to accurately learn textures and reach photorealistic rendering. We validated our method on 2 publicly released surgical videos and 4 videos collected on ex vivo tissues and green screens. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04082](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04082) |

DecompDreamer leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to decompose scenes into structured components and their relationships. We propose a progressive optimization strategy that first prioritizes joint relationship modeling before gradually shifting toward targeted object refinement.

Hence, high quality and fast mapping becomes a fundamental problem. With the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as an explicit representation with excellent rendering quality and speed, state-of-the-art (SOTA) works introduce GS to SLAM. Compared to classical pointcloud-SLAM, GS-SLAM generates photometric information by learning from input camera views and synthesize unseen views with high-quality textures. However, these GS-SLAM fail when moving objects occupy the scene that violate the static assumption of bundle adjustment. The failed updates of moving GS affects the static GS and contaminates the full map over long frames. Although some efforts have been made by concurrent works to consider moving objects for GS-SLAM, they simply detect and remove the moving regions from GS rendering ("anti'' dynamic GS-SLAM), where only the static background could benefit from GS. To this end, we propose the first real-time GS-SLAM, "DynaGSLAM'', that achieves high-quality online GS rendering, tracking, motion predictions of moving objects in dynamic scenes while jointly estimating accurate ego motion. Our DynaGSLAM outperforms SOTA static & "Anti'' dynamic GS-SLAM on three dynamic real datasets, while keeping speed and memory efficiency in practice.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11979](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11979) |

Existing editing approaches face two critical challenges: inconsistent geometric reconstructions across multiple viewpoints, particularly in challenging camera positions, and ineffective utilization of depth information during image manipulation, resulting in over-texture artifacts and degraded object boundaries. To address these limitations, we introduce: 1) A complementary information mutual learning network that enhances depth map estimation from 3DGS, enabling precise depth-conditioned 3D editing while preserving geometric structures. 2) A wavelet consensus attention mechanism that effectively aligns latent codes during the diffusion denoising process, ensuring multi-view consistency in the edited results. Through extensive experimentation, our method demonstrates superior performance in rendering quality and view consistency compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The results validate our framework as an effective solution for text-guided editing of 3D scenes.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11601](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11601) |

Occlusions and varied viewpoints can lead to multi-view semantic inconsistencies, while dynamic objects may act as transient distractors, introducing artifacts into semantic feature modeling. To address these challenges, we propose EgoSplat, a language-embedded 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for open-vocabulary egocentric scene understanding. A multi-view consistent instance feature aggregation method is designed to leverage the segmentation and tracking capabilities of SAM2 to selectively aggregate complementary features across views for each instance, ensuring precise semantic representation of scenes. Additionally, an instance-aware spatial-temporal transient prediction module is constructed to improve spatial integrity and temporal continuity in predictions by incorporating spatial-temporal associations across multi-view instances, effectively reducing artifacts in the semantic reconstruction of egocentric scenes. EgoSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in both localization and segmentation tasks on two datasets, outperforming existing methods with a 8.2% improvement in localization accuracy and a 3.7% improvement in segmentation mIoU on the ADT dataset, and setting a new benchmark in open-vocabulary egocentric scene understanding.

| 304 | GauSTAR: Gaussian Surface Tracking and Reconstruction | Chengwei Zheng,Lixin Xue,Juan Zarate,Jie Song | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting techniques have enabled efficient photo-realistic rendering of static scenes. Recent works have extended these approaches to support surface reconstruction and tracking. However, tracking dynamic surfaces with 3D Gaussians remains challenging due to complex topology changes, such as surfaces appearing, disappearing, or splitting. To address these challenges, we propose GauSTAR, a novel method that achieves photo-realistic rendering, accurate surface reconstruction, and reliable 3D tracking for general dynamic scenes with changing topology. Given multi-view captures as input, GauSTAR binds Gaussians to mesh faces to represent dynamic objects. For surfaces with consistent topology, GauSTAR maintains the mesh topology and tracks the meshes using Gaussians. For regions where topology changes, GauSTAR adaptively unbinds Gaussians from the mesh, enabling accurate registration and generation of new surfaces based on these optimized Gaussians. Additionally, we introduce a surface-based scene flow method that provides robust initialization for tracking between frames. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively tracks and reconstructs dynamic surfaces, enabling a range of applications.

This paper introduces a Gaussian Splatting (GS) based system to address these challenges: We first break down sensor simulator components and analyze the possible advantages of GS over NeRF. Then in practice, we refactor three crucial components through GS, to leverage its explicit scene representation and real-time rendering: (1) choosing the 2D neural Gaussian representation for physics-compliant scene and sensor modeling, (2) proposing a scene editing pipeline to leverage Gaussian primitives library for data augmentation, and (3) coupling a controllable diffusion model for scene expansion and harmonization. We implement this framework on a proprietary autonomous driving dataset supporting cameras and LiDAR sensors. We demonstrate through ablation studies that our approach reduces frame-wise simulation latency, achieves better geometric and photometric consistency, and enables interpretable explicit scene editing and expansion. Furthermore, we showcase how integrating such a GS-based sensor simulator with traffic and dynamic simulators enables full-stack testing of end-to-end autonomy algorithms. Our work provides both algorithmic insights and practical validation, establishing GS as a cornerstone for industrial-grade sensor simulation.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11731](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11731) |

Recent GS methods proposed for cameras have achieved significant advancements in real-time rendering beyond Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, applying GS representation to LiDAR, an active 3D sensor type, poses several challenges that must be addressed to preserve high accuracy and unique characteristics. Specifically, LiDAR-GS designs a differentiable laser beam splatting, using range-view representation for precise surface splatting by projecting lasers onto micro cross-sections, effectively eliminating artifacts associated with local affine approximations. Furthermore, LiDAR-GS leverages Neural Gaussian Representation, which further integrate view-dependent clues, to represent key LiDAR properties that are influenced by the incident direction and external factors. Combining these practices with some essential adaptations, e.g., dynamic instances decomposition, LiDAR-GS succeeds in simultaneously re-simulating depth, intensity, and ray-drop channels, achieving state-of-the-art results in both rendering frame rate and quality on publically available large scene datasets when compared with the methods using explicit mesh or implicit NeRF.

| 301 | Uncertainty-Aware Normal-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Surface Reconstruction from Sparse Image Sequences | Zhen Tan,Xieyuanli Chen,Jinpu Zhang,Lei Feng,Dewen Hu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has achieved impressive rendering performance in novel view synthesis. However, its efficacy diminishes considerably in sparse image sequences, where inherent data sparsity amplifies geometric uncertainty during optimization. This often leads to convergence at suboptimal local minima, resulting in noticeable structural artifacts in the reconstructed scenes.To mitigate these issues, we propose Uncertainty-aware Normal-Guided Gaussian Splatting (UNG-GS), a novel framework featuring an explicit Spatial Uncertainty Field (SUF) to quantify geometric uncertainty within the 3DGS pipeline. UNG-GS enables high-fidelity rendering and achieves high-precision reconstruction without relying on priors. Specifically, we first integrate Gaussian-based probabilistic modeling into the training of 3DGS to optimize the SUF, providing the model with adaptive error tolerance. An uncertainty-aware depth rendering strategy is then employed to weight depth contributions based on the SUF, effectively reducing noise while preserving fine details. Furthermore, an uncertainty-guided normal refinement method adjusts the influence of neighboring depth values in normal estimation, promoting robust results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNG-GS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both sparse and dense sequences. The code will be open-source.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11172](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11172) |
| 300 | RI3D: Few-Shot Gaussian Splatting With Repair and Inpainting Diffusion Priors | Avinash Paliwal,Xilong Zhou,Wei Ye,Jinhui Xiong,Rakesh Ranjan,Nima Khademi Kalantari | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we propose RI3D, a novel 3DGS-based approach that harnesses the power of diffusion models to reconstruct high-quality novel views given a sparse set of input images. Our key contribution is separating the view synthesis process into two tasks of reconstructing visible regions and hallucinating missing regions, and introducing two personalized diffusion models, each tailored to one of these tasks. Specifically, one model ('repair') takes a rendered image as input and predicts the corresponding high-quality image, which in turn is used as a pseudo ground truth image to constrain the optimization. The other model ('inpainting') primarily focuses on hallucinating details in unobserved areas. To integrate these models effectively, we introduce a two-stage optimization strategy: the first stage reconstructs visible areas using the repair model, and the second stage reconstructs missing regions with the inpainting model while ensuring coherence through further optimization. Moreover, we augment the optimization with a novel Gaussian initialization method that obtains per-image depth by combining 3D-consistent and smooth depth with highly detailed relative depth. We demonstrate that by separating the process into two tasks and addressing them with the repair and inpainting models, we produce results with detailed textures in both visible and missing regions that outperform state-of-the-art approaches on a diverse set of scenes with extremely sparse inputs.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10860](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10860) |

To overcome this, we propose the Avatar Concept Slider (ACS), a 3D avatar editing method that allows precise editing of semantic concepts in human avatars towards a specified intermediate point between two extremes of concepts, akin to moving a knob along a slider track. To achieve this, our ACS has three designs: Firstly, a Concept Sliding Loss based on linear discriminant analysis to pinpoint the concept-specific axes for precise editing. Secondly, an Attribute Preserving Loss based on principal component analysis for improved preservation of avatar identity during editing. We further propose a 3D Gaussian Splatting primitive selection mechanism based on concept-sensitivity, which updates only the primitives that are the most sensitive to our target concept, to improve efficiency. Results demonstrate that our ACS enables controllable 3D avatar editing, without compromising the avatar quality or its identifying attributes.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13995](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13995) |

Recent advances in 3D human reconstruction mainly focus on static human modeling, and the reliance of using synthetic 3D scans for training limits their generalization ability. Conversely, optimization-based video methods achieve higher fidelity but demand controlled capture conditions and computationally intensive refinement processes. Motivated by the emergence of large reconstruction models for efficient static reconstruction, we propose LHM (Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model) to infer high-fidelity avatars represented as 3D Gaussian splatting in a feed-forward pass. Our model leverages a multimodal transformer architecture to effectively encode the human body positional features and image features with attention mechanism, enabling detailed preservation of clothing geometry and texture. To further boost the face identity preservation and fine detail recovery, we propose a head feature pyramid encoding scheme to aggregate multi-scale features of the head regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LHM generates plausible animatable human in seconds without post-processing for face and hands, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10625](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10625) |

However, when we apply 3DGS to surface reconstruction tasks, especially in environments with dynamic objects and distractors, the method suffers from floating artifacts and color errors due to inconsistency from different viewpoints. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-View Consistency Gaussian Splatting for the domain of Robust Surface Reconstruction (\\textbf{MVGSR}), which takes advantage of lightweight Gaussian models and a {heuristics-guided distractor masking} strategy for robust surface reconstruction in non-static environments. Compared to existing methods that rely on MLPs for distractor segmentation strategies, our approach separates distractors from static scene elements by comparing multi-view feature consistency, allowing us to obtain precise distractor masks early in training. Furthermore, we introduce a pruning measure based on multi-view contributions to reset transmittance, effectively reducing floating artifacts. Finally, a multi-view consistency loss is applied to achieve high-quality performance in surface reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MVGSR achieves competitive geometric accuracy and rendering fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art surface reconstruction algorithms.

Simulation is a key ingredient for conducting such testing in a cost-effective and scalable way. Neural rendering methods have gained popularity, as they can build simulation environments from collected logs in a data-driven manner. However, existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods for sensor-realistic rendering of camera and lidar data suffer from low rendering speeds, limiting their applicability for large-scale testing. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering, current methods are limited to camera data and are unable to render lidar data essential for autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose SplatAD, the first 3DGS-based method for realistic, real-time rendering of dynamic scenes for both camera and lidar data. SplatAD accurately models key sensor-specific phenomena such as rolling shutter effects, lidar intensity, and lidar ray dropouts, using purpose-built algorithms to optimize rendering efficiency. Evaluation across three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that SplatAD achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with up to +2 PSNR for NVS and +3 PSNR for reconstruction while increasing rendering speed over NeRF-based methods by an order of magnitude.

The core of our method lies in a novel transformer-based network architecture. In particular, our model starts with an image encoder that maps each image to a list of visual tokens. All visual tokens are concatenated with additional inserted learnable camera tokens. The obtained tokens then fully communicate with each other within a tailored transformer decoder. The camera tokens causally aggregate features from visual tokens of different views, and further modulate them frame-wisely to inject view-dependent features. 3D Gaussian splats and camera pose parameters can then be estimated via different prediction heads. Experiments show that VicaSplat surpasses baseline methods for multi-view inputs, and achieves comparable performance to prior two-view approaches. Remarkably, VicaSplat also demonstrates exceptional cross-dataset generalization capability on the ScanNet benchmark, achieving superior performance without any fine-tuning.

Isolating individual 3D Gaussian primitives for each object and handling occlusions in scenes remain far from being solved. We propose a novel object extraction method based on two key principles: (1) being object-centric by pruning irrelevant primitives; and (2) leveraging generative inpainting to compensate for missing observations caused by occlusions. For pruning, we analyze the local structure of primitives using K-nearest neighbors, and retain only relevant ones. For inpainting, we employ an off-the-shelf diffusion-based inpainter combined with occlusion reasoning, utilizing the 3D representation of the entire scene. Our findings highlight the crucial synergy between pruning and inpainting, both of which significantly enhance extraction performance. We evaluate our method on a standard real-world dataset and introduce a synthetic dataset for quantitative analysis. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, demonstrating its effectiveness in object extraction from complex scenes.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10256) |

However, achieving high-granularity surface reconstruction and high-fidelity rendering remains a challenge. Gaussian splatting offers efficient photorealistic rendering but struggles with geometric inconsistencies due to fragmented primitives and sparse observational data in robotics applications. Existing regularization methods, which rely on render-derived constraints, often fail in complex environments. Moreover, effectively integrating sparse LiDAR data with Gaussian splatting remains challenging. We propose a unified LiDAR-visual system that synergizes Gaussian splatting with a neural signed distance field. The accurate LiDAR point clouds enable a trained neural signed distance field to offer a manifold geometry field, This motivates us to offer an SDF-based Gaussian initialization for physically grounded primitive placement and a comprehensive geometric regularization for geometrically consistent rendering and reconstruction.

| 291 | GaussHDR: High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting via Learning Unified 3D and 2D Local Tone Mapping | Jinfeng Liu,Lingtong Kong,Bo Li,Dan Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>High dynamic range (HDR) novel view synthesis (NVS) aims to reconstruct HDR scenes by leveraging multi-view low dynamic range (LDR) images captured at different exposure levels. Current training paradigms with 3D tone mapping often result in unstable HDR reconstruction, while training with 2D tone mapping reduces the model's capacity to fit LDR images. Additionally, the global tone mapper used in existing methods can impede the learning of both HDR and LDR representations. To address these challenges, we present GaussHDR, which unifies 3D and 2D local tone mapping through 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we design a residual local tone mapper for both 3D and 2D tone mapping that accepts an additional context feature as input. We then propose combining the dual LDR rendering results from both 3D and 2D local tone mapping at the loss level. Finally, recognizing that different scenes may exhibit varying balances between the dual results, we introduce uncertainty learning and use the uncertainties for adaptive modulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaussHDR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10143](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10143) |
| 290 | DoF-Gaussian: Controllable Depth-of-Field for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Liao Shen,Tianqi Liu,Huiqiang Sun,Jiaqi Li,Zhiguo Cao,Wei Li,Chen Change Loy | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) have shown remarkable success in representing 3D scenes and generating high-quality, novel views in real-time. However, 3D-GS and its variants assume that input images are captured based on pinhole imaging and are fully in focus. This assumption limits their applicability, as real-world images often feature shallow depth-of-field (DoF). In this paper, we introduce DoF-Gaussian, a controllable depth-of-field method for 3D-GS. We develop a lens-based imaging model based on geometric optics principles to control DoF effects. To ensure accurate scene geometry, we incorporate depth priors adjusted per scene, and we apply defocus-to-focus adaptation to minimize the gap in the circle of confusion. We also introduce a synthetic dataset to assess refocusing capabilities and the model's ability to learn precise lens parameters. Our framework is customizable and supports various interactive applications. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method.

At their core is Novel View Synthesis (NVS), a crucial capability that generates diverse unseen viewpoints to accommodate the broad and continuous pose distribution of AVs. Recent advances in radiance fields, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieve photorealistic rendering at real-time speeds and have been widely used in modeling large-scale driving scenes. However, their performance is commonly evaluated using an interpolated setup with highly correlated training and test views. In contrast, extrapolation, where test views largely deviate from training views, remains underexplored, limiting progress in generalizable simulation technology. To address this gap, we leverage publicly available AV datasets with multiple traversals, multiple vehicles, and multiple cameras to build the first Extrapolated Urban View Synthesis (EUVS) benchmark. Meanwhile, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of state-of-the-art NVS methods across different evaluation settings. Our results show that current NVS methods are prone to overfitting to training views. Besides, incorporating diffusion priors and improving geometry cannot fundamentally improve NVS under large view changes, highlighting the need for more robust approaches and large-scale training. We will release the data to help advance self-driving and urban robotics simulation technology.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05256) |

However, these models are typically limited to handling in-domain objects closely following their original trajectories. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with physics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based rendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for real-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR simulation.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09464](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09464) |
| 287 | Online Language Splatting | Saimouli Katragadda,Cho-Ying Wu,Yuliang Guo,Xinyu Huang,Guoquan Huang,Liu Ren | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>To enable AI agents to interact seamlessly with both humans and 3D environments, they must not only perceive the 3D world accurately but also align human language with 3D spatial representations. While prior work has made significant progress by integrating language features into geometrically detailed 3D scene representations using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), these approaches rely on computationally intensive offline preprocessing of language features for each input image, limiting adaptability to new environments. In this work, we introduce Online Language Splatting, the first framework to achieve online, near real-time, open-vocabulary language mapping within a 3DGS-SLAM system without requiring pre-generated language features. The key challenge lies in efficiently fusing high-dimensional language features into 3D representations while balancing the computation speed, memory usage, rendering quality and open-vocabulary capability. To this end, we innovatively design: (1) a high-resolution CLIP embedding module capable of generating detailed language feature maps in 18ms per frame, (2) a two-stage online auto-encoder that compresses 768-dimensional CLIP features to 15 dimensions while preserving open-vocabulary capabilities, and (3) a color-language disentangled optimization approach to improve rendering quality. Experimental results show that our online method not only surpasses the state-of-the-art offline methods in accuracy but also achieves more than 40x efficiency boost, demonstrating the potential for dynamic and interactive AI applications.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09447](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09447) |
| 286 | Fast Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression | Yihang Chen,Qianyi Wu,Mengyao Li,Weiyao Lin,Mehrtash Harandi,Jianfei Cai | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>With 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) advancing real-time and high-fidelity rendering for novel view synthesis, storage requirements pose challenges for their widespread adoption. Although various compression techniques have been proposed, previous art suffers from a common limitation: for any existing 3DGS, per-scene optimization is needed to achieve compression, making the compression sluggish and slow. To address this issue, we introduce Fast Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting (FCGS), an optimization-free model that can compress 3DGS representations rapidly in a single feed-forward pass, which significantly reduces compression time from minutes to seconds. To enhance compression efficiency, we propose a multi-path entropy module that assigns Gaussian attributes to different entropy constraint paths for balance between size and fidelity. We also carefully design both inter- and intra-Gaussian context models to remove redundancies among the unstructured Gaussian blobs. Overall, FCGS achieves a compression ratio of over 20X while maintaining fidelity, surpassing most per-scene SOTA optimization-based methods.

| 285 | Close-up-GS: Enhancing Close-Up View Synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting with Progressive Self-Training | Jiatong Xia,Lingqiao Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing novel views after training on a given set of viewpoints. However, its rendering quality deteriorates when the synthesized view deviates significantly from the training views. This decline occurs due to (1) the model's difficulty in generalizing to out-of-distribution scenarios and (2) challenges in interpolating fine details caused by substantial resolution changes and occlusions. A notable case of this limitation is close-up view generation--producing views that are significantly closer to the object than those in the training set. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach for close-up view generation based by progressively training the 3DGS model with self-generated data. Our solution is based on three key ideas. First, we leverage the See3D model, a recently introduced 3D-aware generative model, to enhance the details of rendered views. Second, we propose a strategy to progressively expand the ``trust regions'' of the 3DGS model and update a set of reference views for See3D. Finally, we introduce a fine-tuning strategy to carefully update the 3DGS model with training data generated from the above schemes. We further define metrics for close-up views evaluation to facilitate better research on this problem. By conducting evaluations on specifically selected scenarios for close-up views, our proposed approach demonstrates a clear advantage over competitive solutions.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09396](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09396) |
| 284 | GASPACHO: Gaussian Splatting for Controllable Humans and Objects | Aymen Mir,Arthur Moreau,Helisa Dhamo,Zhensong Zhang,Eduardo P\xc3\xa9rez-Pellitero | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present GASPACHO: a method for generating photorealistic controllable renderings of human-object interactions. Given a set of multi-view RGB images of human-object interactions, our method reconstructs animatable templates of the human and object as separate sets of Gaussians simultaneously. Different from existing work, which focuses on human reconstruction and ignores objects as background, our method explicitly reconstructs both humans and objects, thereby allowing for controllable renderings of novel human object interactions in different poses from novel-camera viewpoints. During reconstruction, we constrain the Gaussians that generate rendered images to be a linear function of a set of canonical Gaussians. By simply changing the parameters of the linear deformation functions after training, our method can generate renderings of novel human-object interaction in novel poses from novel camera viewpoints. We learn the 3D Gaussian properties of the canonical Gaussians on the underlying 2D manifold of the canonical human and object templates. This in turns requires a canonical object template with a fixed UV unwrapping. To define such an object template, we use a feature based representation to track the object across the multi-view sequence. We further propose an occlusion aware photometric loss that allows for reconstructions under significant occlusions. Several experiments on two human-object datasets - BEHAVE and DNA-Rendering - demonstrate that our method allows for high-quality reconstruction of human and object templates under significant occlusion and the synthesis of controllable renderings of novel human-object interactions in novel human poses from novel camera views.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09342](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09342) |
| 283 | SDD-4DGS: Static-Dynamic Aware Decoupling in Gaussian Splatting for 4D Scene Reconstruction | Dai Sun,Huhao Guan,Kun Zhang,Xike Xie,S. Kevin Zhou | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Dynamic and static components in scenes often exhibit distinct properties, yet most 4D reconstruction methods treat them indiscriminately, leading to suboptimal performance in both cases. This work introduces SDD-4DGS, the first framework for static-dynamic decoupled 4D scene reconstruction based on Gaussian Splatting. Our approach is built upon a novel probabilistic dynamic perception coefficient that is naturally integrated into the Gaussian reconstruction pipeline, enabling adaptive separation of static and dynamic components. With carefully designed implementation strategies to realize this theoretical framework, our method effectively facilitates explicit learning of motion patterns for dynamic elements while maintaining geometric stability for static structures. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SDD-4DGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction fidelity, with enhanced detail restoration for static structures and precise modeling of dynamic motions. The code will be released.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09332](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09332) |
| 282 | EVA-Gaussian: 3D Gaussian-based Real-time Human Novel View Synthesis under Diverse Multi-view Camera Settings | Yingdong Hu,Zhening Liu,Jiawei Shao,Zehong Lin,Jun Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Feed-forward based 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have demonstrated exceptional capability in real-time novel view synthesis for human models. However, current approaches are confined to either dense viewpoint configurations or restricted image resolutions. These limitations hinder their flexibility in free-viewpoint rendering across a wide range of camera view angle discrepancies, and also restrict their ability to recover fine-grained human details in real time using commonly available GPUs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline named EVA-Gaussian for 3D human novel view synthesis across diverse multi-view camera settings. Specifically, we first design an Efficient Cross-View Attention (EVA) module to effectively fuse cross-view information under high resolution inputs and sparse view settings, while minimizing temporal and computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce a feature refinement mechianism to predict the attributes of the 3D Gaussians and assign a feature value to each Gaussian, enabling the correction of artifacts caused by geometric inaccuracies in position estimation and enhancing overall visual fidelity. Experimental results on the THuman2.0 and THumansit datasets showcase the superiority of EVA-Gaussian in rendering quality across diverse camera settings.

| 281 | Generalized and Efficient 2D Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution | Du Chen,Liyi Chen,Zhengqiang Zhang,Lei Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has been successfully employed for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution (ASR). However, INR-based models need to query the multi-layer perceptron module numerous times and render a pixel in each query, resulting in insufficient representation capability and computational efficiency. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown its advantages over INR in both visual quality and rendering speed in 3D tasks, which motivates us to explore whether GS can be employed for the ASR task. However, directly applying GS to ASR is exceptionally challenging because the original GS is an optimization-based method through overfitting each single scene, while in ASR we aim to learn a single model that can generalize to different images and scaling factors. We overcome these challenges by developing two novel techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we elaborately design an architecture to predict the corresponding image-conditioned Gaussians of the input low-resolution image in a feed-forward manner. Each Gaussian can fit the shape and direction of an area of complex textures, showing powerful representation capability. Secondly, we implement an efficient differentiable 2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render super-resolved images by sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted continuous Gaussians. Via end-to-end training, our optimized network, namely GSASR, can perform ASR for any image and unseen scaling factors. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06838](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06838) |

To this end, we first analyze the local coherence of 3D Gaussian attributes, and propose a novel locality-aware 3D Gaussian representation that effectively encodes locally-coherent Gaussian attributes using a neural field representation with a minimal storage requirement. On top of the novel representation, LocoGS is carefully designed with additional components such as dense initialization, an adaptive spherical harmonics bandwidth scheme and different encoding schemes for different Gaussian attributes to maximize compression performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the rendering quality of existing compact Gaussian representations for representative real-world 3D datasets while achieving from 54.6$\\times$ to 96.6$\\times$ compressed storage size and from 2.1$\\times$ to 2.4$\\times$ rendering speed than 3DGS.

Tracking points allow for geometric reconstruction [14], while geometric reconstruction of (dynamic) scenes allows for 3D tracking of points over time [24, 39]. The latter was recently also exploited for 2D point tracking to overcome occlusion ambiguities by lifting tracking directly into 3D [38]. However, above approaches either require offline processing or multi-view camera setups both unrealistic for real-world applications like robot navigation or mixed reality. We target the challenge of online 2D and 3D point tracking from unposed monocular camera input introducing Dynamic Online Monocular Reconstruction (DynOMo). We leverage 3D Gaussian splatting to reconstruct dynamic scenes in an online fashion. Our approach extends 3D Gaussians to capture new content and object motions while estimating camera movements from a single RGB frame. DynOMo stands out by enabling emergence of point trajectories through robust image feature reconstruction and a novel similarity-enhanced regularization term, without requiring any correspondence-level supervision. It sets the first baseline for online point tracking with monocular unposed cameras, achieving performance on par with existing methods. We aim to inspire the community to advance online point tracking and reconstruction, expanding the applicability to diverse real-world scenarios.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02104](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02104) |

Previous COLMAP-Free methods optimize camera poses using local constraints, but they often struggle in complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce TrackGS, which incorporates feature tracks to globally constrain multi-view geometry. We select the Gaussians associated with each track, which will be trained and rescaled to an infinitesimally small size to guarantee the spatial accuracy. We also propose minimizing both reprojection and backprojection errors for better geometric consistency. Moreover, by deriving the gradient of intrinsics, we unify camera parameter estimation with 3DGS training into a joint optimization framework, achieving SOTA performance on challenging datasets with severe camera movements.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19800](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19800) |

We present EigenGS, a novel method that bridges these paradigms through an efficient transformation pipeline connecting eigenspace and image-space Gaussian representations. Our approach enables instant initialization of Gaussian parameters for new images without requiring per-image optimization from scratch, dramatically accelerating convergence. EigenGS introduces a frequency-aware learning mechanism that encourages Gaussians to adapt to different scales, effectively modeling varied spatial frequencies and preventing artifacts in high-resolution reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EigenGS not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to direct 2D Gaussian fitting but also reduces necessary parameter count and training time. The results highlight EigenGS's effectiveness and generalization ability across images with varying resolutions and diverse categories, making Gaussian-based image representation both high-quality and viable for real-time applications.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07446](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07446) |

Existing methods always struggle with either low rendering qualities (\\eg, visual fidelity and physically plausible HOIs) or high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose HOGS (Human-Object Rendering via 3D Gaussian Splatting), a novel framework for efficient and physically plausible HOI rendering from sparse views. Specifically, HOGS combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with a physics-aware optimization process. It incorporates a Human Pose Refinement module for accurate pose estimation and a Sparse-View Human-Object Contact Prediction module for efficient contact region identification. This combination enables coherent joint rendering of human and object Gaussians while enforcing physically plausible interactions. Extensive experiments on the HODome dataset demonstrate that HOGS achieves superior rendering quality, efficiency, and physical plausibility compared to existing methods.

| 275 | Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Reconstruction | Xinyu Zhang,Haonan Chang,Yuhan Liu,Abdeslam Boularias | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful tool for high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic scenes. However, existing methods primarily rely on implicit motion representations, such as encoding motions into neural networks or per-Gaussian parameters, which makes it difficult to further manipulate the reconstructed motions. This lack of explicit controllability limits existing methods to replaying recorded motions only, which hinders a wider application. To address this, we propose Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting (MB-GS), a novel framework that uses motion graph as an explicit and sparse motion representation. The motion of graph links is propagated to individual Gaussians via dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight painting functions determining the influence of each link. The motion graphs and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized from input videos via differentiable rendering. Experiments show that MB-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the iPhone dataset while being competitive on HyperNeRF.

However, 3DGS tends to overfit when trained with sparse views, limiting its generalization to novel viewpoints. In this paper, we address this overfitting issue by introducing Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting (SE-GS). We achieve self-ensembling by incorporating an uncertainty-aware perturbation strategy during training. A $\\mathbf\xce\x94$-model and a $\\mathbf\xce\xa3$-model are jointly trained on the available images. The $\\mathbf\xce\x94$-model is dynamically perturbed based on rendering uncertainty across training steps, generating diverse perturbed models with negligible computational overhead. Discrepancies between the $\\mathbf\xce\xa3$-model and these perturbed models are minimized throughout training, forming a robust ensemble of 3DGS models. This ensemble, represented by the $\\mathbf\xce\xa3$-model, is then used to generate novel-view images during inference. Experimental results on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and MVImgNet datasets demonstrate that our approach enhances NVS quality under few-shot training conditions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

| 273 | Free Your Hands: Lightweight Relightable Turntable Capture Pipeline | Jiahui Fan,Fujun Luan,Jian Yang,Milo\xc5\xa1 Ha\xc5\xa1an,Beibei Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis (NVS) from multiple captured photos of an object is a widely studied problem. Achieving high quality typically requires dense sampling of input views, which can lead to frustrating and tedious manual labor. Manually positioning cameras to maintain an optimal desired distribution can be difficult for humans, and if a good distribution is found, it is not easy to replicate. Additionally, the captured data can suffer from motion blur and defocus due to human error. In this paper, we present a lightweight object capture pipeline to reduce the manual workload and standardize the acquisition setup. We use a consumer turntable to carry the object and a tripod to hold the camera. As the turntable rotates, we automatically capture dense samples from various views and lighting conditions; we can repeat this for several camera positions. This way, we can easily capture hundreds of valid images in several minutes without hands-on effort. However, in the object reference frame, the light conditions vary; this is harmful to a standard NVS method like 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) which assumes fixed lighting. We design a neural radiance representation conditioned on light rotations, which addresses this issue and allows relightability as an additional benefit. We demonstrate our pipeline using 3DGS as the underlying framework, achieving competitive quality compared to previous methods with exhaustive acquisition and showcasing its potential for relighting and harmonization tasks.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05511](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05511) |

| 270 | FAST-Splat: Fast, Ambiguity-Free Semantics Transfer in Gaussian Splatting | Ola Shorinwa,Jiankai Sun,Mac Schwager | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present FAST-Splat for fast, ambiguity-free semantic Gaussian Splatting, which seeks to address the main limitations of existing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods, namely: slow training and rendering speeds; high memory usage; and ambiguous semantic object localization. We take a bottom-up approach in deriving FAST-Splat, dismantling the limitations of closed-set semantic distillation to enable open-set (open-vocabulary) semantic distillation. Ultimately, this key approach enables FAST-Splat to provide precise semantic object localization results, even when prompted with ambiguous user-provided natural-language queries. Further, by exploiting the explicit form of the Gaussian Splatting scene representation to the fullest extent, FAST-Splat retains the remarkable training and rendering speeds of Gaussian Splatting. Precisely, while existing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods distill semantics into a separate neural field or utilize neural models for dimensionality reduction, FAST-Splat directly augments each Gaussian with specific semantic codes, preserving the training, rendering, and memory-usage advantages of Gaussian Splatting over neural field methods. These Gaussian-specific semantic codes, together with a hash-table, enable semantic similarity to be measured with open-vocabulary user prompts and further enable FAST-Splat to respond with unambiguous semantic object labels and $3$D masks, unlike prior methods. In experiments, we demonstrate that FAST-Splat is 6x to 8x faster to train, achieves between 18x to 51x faster rendering speeds, and requires about 6x smaller GPU memory, compared to the best-competing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods. Further, FAST-Splat achieves relatively similar or better semantic segmentation performance compared to existing methods.

Commonly used publicly-available AD datasets typically contain large amounts of car and vehicle object instances but a low number of cyclist instances, usually with limited appearance and pose diversity. This cyclist training data scarcity problem not only limits the generalization of deep-learning perception models for cyclist semantic segmentation, pose estimation, and cyclist crossing intention prediction, but also limits research on new cyclist-related tasks such as fine-grained cyclist pose estimation and spatio-temporal analysis under complex interactions between humans and articulated objects. To address this data scarcity problem, in this paper we propose a framework to generate synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist data assets that can be used to generate training data for different tasks. In our framework, we designed a methodology for creating a new part-based multi-view articulated synthetic 3D bicycle dataset that we call 3DArticBikes that we use to train a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based reconstruction and image rendering method. We then propose a parametric bicycle 3DGS composition model to assemble 8-DoF pose-controllable 3D bicycles. Finally, using dynamic information from cyclist videos, we build a complete synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist (rider pedaling a bicycle) by re-posing a selectable synthetic 3D person, while automatically placing the rider onto one of our new articulated 3D bicycles using a proposed 3D Keypoint optimization-based Inverse Kinematics pose refinement. We present both, qualitative and quantitative results where we compare our generated cyclists against those from a recent stable diffusion-based method.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10782](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10782) |
| 268 | FPGS: Feed-Forward Semantic-aware Photorealistic Style Transfer of Large-Scale Gaussian Splatting | GeonU Kim,Kim Youwang,Lee Hyoseok,Tae-Hyun Oh | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present FPGS, a feed-forward photorealistic style transfer method of large-scale radiance fields represented by Gaussian Splatting. FPGS, stylizes large-scale 3D scenes with arbitrary, multiple style reference images without additional optimization while preserving multi-view consistency and real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussians. Prior arts required tedious per-style optimization or time-consuming per-scene training stage and were limited to small-scale 3D scenes. FPGS efficiently stylizes large-scale 3D scenes by introducing a style-decomposed 3D feature field, which inherits AdaIN's feed-forward stylization machinery, supporting arbitrary style reference images. Furthermore, FPGS supports multi-reference stylization with the semantic correspondence matching and local AdaIN, which adds diverse user control for 3D scene styles. FPGS also preserves multi-view consistency by applying semantic matching and style transfer processes directly onto queried features in 3D space. In experiments, we demonstrate that FPGS achieves favorable photorealistic quality scene stylization for large-scale static and dynamic 3D scenes with diverse reference images.

Our method optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation to match complex text prompts using pretrained diffusion models. Our key insight is to leverage 2D inpainting diffusion models conditioned on an initial scene estimate to provide low variance supervision for unknown regions during 3D distillation. In conjunction, we imbue high-fidelity geometry with geometric distillation from a depth diffusion model, conditioned on samples from the inpainting model. We find that the initialization of the optimization is crucial, and provide a principled methodology for doing so. Notably, our technique doesn't require video or multi-view data and can synthesize various high-quality 3D scenes in different styles with complex layouts. Further, the generality of our method allows 3D synthesis from a single image. As measured by a comprehensive user study, our method outperforms all existing approaches, preferred by 88-95%.

| 266 | PCGS: Progressive Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting | Yihang Chen,Mengyao Li,Qianyi Wu,Weiyao Lin,Mehrtash Harandi,Jianfei Cai | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves impressive rendering fidelity and speed for novel view synthesis. However, its substantial data size poses a significant challenge for practical applications. While many compression techniques have been proposed, they fail to efficiently utilize existing bitstreams in on-demand applications due to their lack of progressivity, leading to a waste of resource. To address this issue, we propose PCGS (Progressive Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting), which adaptively controls both the quantity and quality of Gaussians (or anchors) to enable effective progressivity for on-demand applications. Specifically, for quantity, we introduce a progressive masking strategy that incrementally incorporates new anchors while refining existing ones to enhance fidelity. For quality, we propose a progressive quantization approach that gradually reduces quantization step sizes to achieve finer modeling of Gaussian attributes. Furthermore, to compact the incremental bitstreams, we leverage existing quantization results to refine probability prediction, improving entropy coding efficiency across progressive levels. Overall, PCGS achieves progressivity while maintaining compression performance comparable to SoTA non-progressive methods.

| 265 | TT-GaussOcc: Test-Time Compute for Self-Supervised Occupancy Prediction via Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Splatting | Fengyi Zhang,Huitong Yang,Zheng Zhang,Zi Huang,Yadan Luo | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Self-supervised 3D occupancy prediction offers a promising solution for understanding complex driving scenes without requiring costly 3D annotations. However, training dense voxel decoders to capture fine-grained geometry and semantics can demand hundreds of GPU hours, and such models often fail to adapt to varying voxel resolutions or new classes without extensive retraining. To overcome these limitations, we propose a practical and flexible test-time occupancy prediction framework termed TT-GaussOcc. Our approach incrementally optimizes time-aware 3D Gaussians instantiated from raw sensor streams at runtime, enabling voxelization at arbitrary user-specified resolution. Specifically, TT-GaussOcc operates in a "lift-move-voxel" symphony: we first "lift" surrounding-view semantics obtained from 2D vision foundation models (VLMs) to instantiate Gaussians at non-empty 3D space; Next, we "move" dynamic Gaussians from previous frames along estimated Gaussian scene flow to complete appearance and eliminate trailing artifacts of fast-moving objects, while accumulating static Gaussians to enforce temporal consistency; Finally, we mitigate inherent noises in semantic predictions and scene flow vectors by periodically smoothing neighboring Gaussians during optimization, using proposed trilateral RBF kernels that jointly consider color, semantic, and spatial affinities. The historical static and current dynamic Gaussians are then combined and voxelized to generate occupancy prediction. Extensive experiments on Occ3D and nuCraft with varying voxel resolutions demonstrate that TT-GaussOcc surpasses self-supervised baselines by 46% on mIoU without any offline training, and supports finer voxel resolutions at 2.6 FPS inference speed.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08485](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08485) |
| 264 | ELECTRA: A Symmetry-breaking Cartesian Network for Charge Density Prediction with Floating Orbitals | Jonas Elsborg,Luca Thiede,Al\xc3\xa1n Aspuru-Guzik,Tejs Vegge,Arghya Bhowmik | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present the Electronic Tensor Reconstruction Algorithm (ELECTRA) - an equivariant model for predicting electronic charge densities using "floating" orbitals. Floating orbitals are a long-standing idea in the quantum chemistry community that promises more compact and accurate representations by placing orbitals freely in space, as opposed to centering all orbitals at the position of atoms. Finding ideal placements of these orbitals requires extensive domain knowledge though, which thus far has prevented widespread adoption. We solve this in a data-driven manner by training a Cartesian tensor network to predict orbital positions along with orbital coefficients. This is made possible through a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is used to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule while preserving the rotation equivariance of the charge density itself. Inspired by recent successes of Gaussian Splatting in representing densities in space, we are using Gaussians as our orbitals and predict their weights and covariance matrices. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy on established benchmarks.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08305](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08305) |
| 263 | HRAvatar: High-Quality and Relightable Gaussian Head Avatar | Dongbin Zhang,Yunfei Liu,Lijian Lin,Ye Zhu,Kangjie Chen,Minghan Qin,Yu Li,Haoqian Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing animatable and high-quality 3D head avatars from monocular videos, especially with realistic relighting, is a valuable task. However, the limited information from single-view input, combined with the complex head poses and facial movements, makes this challenging. Previous methods achieve real-time performance by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with a parametric head model, but the resulting head quality suffers from inaccurate face tracking and limited expressiveness of the deformation model. These methods also fail to produce realistic effects under novel lighting conditions. To address these issues, we propose HRAvatar, a 3DGS-based method that reconstructs high-fidelity, relightable 3D head avatars. HRAvatar reduces tracking errors through end-to-end optimization and better captures individual facial deformations using learnable blendshapes and learnable linear blend skinning. Additionally, it decomposes head appearance into several physical properties and incorporates physically-based shading to account for environmental lighting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HRAvatar not only reconstructs superior-quality heads but also achieves realistic visual effects under varying lighting conditions.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08224](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08224) |
| 262 | S3R-GS: Streamlining the Pipeline for Large-Scale Street Scene Reconstruction | Guangting Zheng,Jiajun Deng,Xiaomeng Chu,Yu Yuan,Houqiang Li,Yanyong Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has reshaped the field of photorealistic 3D reconstruction, achieving impressive rendering quality and speed. However, when applied to large-scale street scenes, existing methods suffer from rapidly escalating per-viewpoint reconstruction costs as scene size increases, leading to significant computational overhead. After revisiting the conventional pipeline, we identify three key factors accounting for this issue: unnecessary local-to-global transformations, excessive 3D-to-2D projections, and inefficient rendering of distant content. To address these challenges, we propose S3R-GS, a 3DGS framework that Streamlines the pipeline for large-scale Street Scene Reconstruction, effectively mitigating these limitations. Moreover, most existing street 3DGS methods rely on ground-truth 3D bounding boxes to separate dynamic and static components, but 3D bounding boxes are difficult to obtain, limiting real-world applicability. To address this, we propose an alternative solution with 2D boxes, which are easier to annotate or can be predicted by off-the-shelf vision foundation models. Such designs together make S3R-GS readily adapt to large, in-the-wild scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S3R-GS enhances rendering quality and significantly accelerates reconstruction. Remarkably, when applied to videos from the challenging Argoverse2 dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art PSNR and SSIM, reducing reconstruction time to below 50%--and even 20%--of competing methods.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08217](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08217) |

| 260 | ArticulatedGS: Self-supervised Digital Twin Modeling of Articulated Objects using 3D Gaussian Splatting | Junfu Guo,Yu Xin,Gaoyi Liu,Kai Xu,Ligang Liu,Ruizhen Hu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We tackle the challenge of concurrent reconstruction at the part level with the RGB appearance and estimation of motion parameters for building digital twins of articulated objects using the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) method. With two distinct sets of multi-view imagery, each depicting an object in separate static articulation configurations, we reconstruct the articulated object in 3D Gaussian representations with both appearance and geometry information at the same time. Our approach decoupled multiple highly interdependent parameters through a multi-step optimization process, thereby achieving a stable optimization procedure and high-quality outcomes. We introduce ArticulatedGS, a self-supervised, comprehensive framework that autonomously learns to model shapes and appearances at the part level and synchronizes the optimization of motion parameters, all without reliance on 3D supervision, motion cues, or semantic labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that, among comparable methodologies, our approach has achieved optimal outcomes in terms of part segmentation accuracy, motion estimation accuracy, and visual quality.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08135](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08135) |
| 259 | F3D-Gaus: Feed-forward 3D-aware Generation on ImageNet with Cycle-Aggregative Gaussian Splatting | Yuxin Wang,Qianyi Wu,Dan Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper tackles the problem of generalizable 3D-aware generation from monocular datasets, e.g., ImageNet. The key challenge of this task is learning a robust 3D-aware representation without multi-view or dynamic data, while ensuring consistent texture and geometry across different viewpoints. Although some baseline methods are capable of 3D-aware generation, the quality of the generated images still lags behind state-of-the-art 2D generation approaches, which excel in producing high-quality, detailed images. To address this severe limitation, we propose a novel feed-forward pipeline based on pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting, coined as F3D-Gaus, which can produce more realistic and reliable 3D renderings from monocular inputs. In addition, we introduce a self-supervised cycle-aggregative constraint to enforce cross-view consistency in the learned 3D representation. This training strategy naturally allows aggregation of multiple aligned Gaussian primitives and significantly alleviates the interpolation limitations inherent in single-view pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting. Furthermore, we incorporate video model priors to perform geometry-aware refinement, enhancing the generation of fine details in wide-viewpoint scenarios and improving the model's capability to capture intricate 3D textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves high-quality, multi-view consistent 3D-aware generation from monocular datasets, but also significantly improves training and inference efficiency.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06714](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06714) |
| 258 | Efficient Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Xiaobin Deng,Changyu Diao,Min Li,Ruohan Yu,Duanqing Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated outstanding performance in novel view synthesis, achieving a balance between rendering quality and real-time performance. 3DGS employs Adaptive Density Control (ADC) to increase the number of Gaussians. However, the clone and split operations within ADC are not sufficiently efficient, impacting optimization speed and detail recovery. Additionally, overfitted Gaussians that affect rendering quality may exist, and the original ADC is unable to remove them. To address these issues, we propose two key innovations: (1) Long-Axis Split, which precisely controls the position, shape, and opacity of child Gaussians to minimize the difference before and after splitting. (2) Recovery-Aware Pruning, which leverages differences in recovery speed after resetting opacity to prune overfitted Gaussians, thereby improving generalization performance. Experimental results show that our method significantly enhances rendering quality.

Existing automatic rigging tools face several limitations, including the necessity for manual annotations, rigid skeleton topologies, and limited generalization across diverse shapes and poses. An alternative approach is to generate animatable avatars pre-bound to a rigged template mesh. However, this method often lacks flexibility and is typically limited to realistic human shapes. To address these issues, we present Make-It-Animatable, a novel data-driven method to make any 3D humanoid model ready for character animation in less than one second, regardless of its shapes and poses. Our unified framework generates high-quality blend weights, bones, and pose transformations. By incorporating a particle-based shape autoencoder, our approach supports various 3D representations, including meshes and 3D Gaussian splats. Additionally, we employ a coarse-to-fine representation and a structure-aware modeling strategy to ensure both accuracy and robustness, even for characters with non-standard skeleton structures. We conducted extensive experiments to validate our framework's effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in both quality and speed.

Traditional Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM methods are typically limited to small, bounded indoor settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GigaSLAM, the first NeRF/3DGS-based SLAM framework for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, as demonstrated on the KITTI and KITTI 360 datasets. Our approach employs a hierarchical sparse voxel map representation, where Gaussians are decoded by neural networks at multiple levels of detail. This design enables efficient, scalable mapping and high-fidelity viewpoint rendering across expansive, unbounded scenes. For front-end tracking, GigaSLAM utilizes a metric depth model combined with epipolar geometry and PnP algorithms to accurately estimate poses, while incorporating a Bag-of-Words-based loop closure mechanism to maintain robust alignment over long trajectories. Consequently, GigaSLAM delivers high-precision tracking and visually faithful rendering on urban outdoor benchmarks, establishing a robust SLAM solution for large-scale, long-term scenarios, and significantly extending the applicability of Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems to unbounded outdoor environments.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08071](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08071) |

By establishing a connection between 2D flows and 3D Gaussian dynamic control, our method enables self-supervised optimization and continuity of dynamic Gaussian motions from flow priors. Furthermore, we introduce a 3D spherical vector controlling scheme, which represents the state with a 3D Gaussian trajectory, thereby eliminating the need for complex 1D control signal calculations and simplifying controllable Gaussian modeling.

Current methods often require manual assignment of precise physical properties for simulations or rely on video generation models to predict them, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we rethink the usage of multi-modal large language model (MLLM) in physics-based simulation, and present Sim Anything, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics. We begin with detailed scene reconstruction and object-level 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, progressing to multi-view image in-painting. Inspired by human visual reasoning, we propose MLLM-based Physical Property Perception (MLLM-P3) to predict mean physical properties of objects in a zero-shot manner. Based on the mean values and the object's geometry, the Material Property Distribution Prediction model (MPDP) model then estimates the full distribution, reformulating the problem as probability distribution estimation to reduce computational costs. Finally, we simulate objects in an open-world scene with particles sampled via the Physical-Geometric Adaptive Sampling (PGAS) strategy, efficiently capturing complex deformations and significantly reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our Sim Anything achieves more realistic motion than state-of-the-art methods within 2 minutes on a single GPU.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12789](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12789) |

However, achieving high quality without compromising real-time rendering remains challenging, particularly for physically-based ray tracing with view-dependent effects. Recently, N-dimensional Gaussians (N-DG) introduced a 6D spatial-angular representation to better incorporate view-dependent effects, but the Gaussian representation and control scheme are sub-optimal. In this paper, we revisit 6D Gaussians and introduce 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS), which enhances color and opacity representations and leverages the additional directional information in the 6D space for optimized Gaussian control. Our approach is fully compatible with the 3DGS framework and significantly improves real-time radiance field rendering by better modeling view-dependent effects and fine details. Experiments demonstrate that 6DGS significantly outperforms 3DGS and N-DG, achieving up to a 15.73 dB improvement in PSNR with a reduction of 66.5% Gaussian points compared to 3DGS.

On the other hand, it often encounters the dilemma among anchor features, model size, and rendering quality - large anchor features lead to large 3D models and high-quality rendering whereas reducing anchor features degrades Gaussian attribute prediction which leads to clear artifacts in the rendered textures and geometries. We design SOGS, an anchor-based 3D-GS technique that introduces second-order anchors to achieve superior rendering quality and reduced anchor features and model size simultaneously. Specifically, SOGS incorporates covariance-based second-order statistics and correlation across feature dimensions to augment features within each anchor, compensating for the reduced feature size and improving rendering quality effectively. In addition, it introduces a selective gradient loss to enhance the optimization of scene textures and scene geometries, leading to high-quality rendering with small anchor features. Extensive experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks show that SOGS achieves superior rendering quality in novel view synthesis with clearly reduced model size.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07476](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07476) |

In these applications, coherence across camera frames and multiple views is crucial, be it for robust convergence of a scene reconstruction or for artifact-free fly-throughs. Recent work started mitigating artifacts that break multi-view coherence, including popping artifacts due to inconsistent transparency sorting and perspective-correct outlines of (2D) splats. At the same time, real-time requirements forced such implementations to accept compromises in how transparency of large assemblies of 3D Gaussians is resolved, in turn breaking coherence in other ways. In our work, we aim at achieving maximum coherence, by rendering fully perspective-correct 3D Gaussians while using a high-quality approximation of accurate blending, hybrid transparency, on a per-pixel level, in order to retain real-time frame rates. Our fast and perspectively accurate approach for evaluation of 3D Gaussians does not require matrix inversions, thereby ensuring numerical stability and eliminating the need for special handling of degenerate splats, and the hybrid transparency formulation for blending maintains similar quality as fully resolved per-pixel transparencies at a fraction of the rendering costs. We further show that each of these two components can be independently integrated into Gaussian splatting systems. In combination, they achieve up to 2$\\times$ higher frame rates, 2$\\times$ faster optimization, and equal or better image quality with fewer rendering artifacts compared to traditional 3DGS on common benchmarks.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08129](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08129) |
| 249 | GAGS: Granularity-Aware Feature Distillation for Language Gaussian Splatting | Yuning Peng,Haiping Wang,Yuan Liu,Chenglu Wen,Zhen Dong,Bisheng Yang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D open-vocabulary scene understanding, which accurately perceives complex semantic properties of objects in space, has gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose GAGS, a framework that distills 2D CLIP features into 3D Gaussian splatting, enabling open-vocabulary queries for renderings on arbitrary viewpoints. The main challenge of distilling 2D features for 3D fields lies in the multiview inconsistency of extracted 2D features, which provides unstable supervision for the 3D feature field. GAGS addresses this challenge with two novel strategies. First, GAGS associates the prompt point density of SAM with the camera distances, which significantly improves the multiview consistency of segmentation results. Second, GAGS further decodes a granularity factor to guide the distillation process and this granularity factor can be learned in a unsupervised manner to only select the multiview consistent 2D features in the distillation process. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate significant performance and stability improvements of GAGS in visual grounding and semantic segmentation, with an inference speed 2$\\times$ faster than baseline methods.

| 248 | BillBoard Splatting (BBSplat): Learnable Textured Primitives for Novel View Synthesis | David Svitov,Pietro Morerio,Lourdes Agapito,Alessio Del Bue | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present billboard Splatting (BBSplat) - a novel approach for novel view synthesis based on textured geometric primitives. BBSplat represents the scene as a set of optimizable textured planar primitives with learnable RGB textures and alpha-maps to control their shape. BBSplat primitives can be used in any Gaussian Splatting pipeline as drop-in replacements for Gaussians. The proposed primitives close the rendering quality gap between 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enabling the accurate extraction of 3D mesh as in the 2DGS framework. Additionally, the explicit nature of planar primitives enables the use of the ray-tracing effects in rasterization. Our novel regularization term encourages textures to have a sparser structure, enabling an efficient compression that leads to a reduction in the storage space of the model up to x17 times compared to 3DGS.

| 247 | All That Glitters Is Not Gold: Key-Secured 3D Secrets within 3D Gaussian Splatting | Yan Ren,Shilin Lu,Adams Wai-Kin Kong | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have revolutionized scene reconstruction, opening new possibilities for 3D steganography by hiding 3D secrets within 3D covers. The key challenge in steganography is ensuring imperceptibility while maintaining high-fidelity reconstruction. However, existing methods often suffer from detectability risks and utilize only suboptimal 3DGS features, limiting their full potential. We propose a novel end-to-end key-secured 3D steganography framework (KeySS) that jointly optimizes a 3DGS model and a key-secured decoder for secret reconstruction. Our approach reveals that Gaussian features contribute unequally to secret hiding. The framework incorporates a key-controllable mechanism enabling multi-secret hiding and unauthorized access prevention, while systematically exploring optimal feature update to balance fidelity and security. To rigorously evaluate steganographic imperceptibility beyond conventional 2D metrics, we introduce 3D-Sinkhorn distance analysis, which quantifies distributional differences between original and steganographic Gaussian parameters in the representation space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both cover and secret reconstruction while maintaining high security levels, advancing the field of 3D steganography.

| 246 | Multi-Modal 3D Mesh Reconstruction from Images and Text | Melvin Reka,Tessa Pulli,Markus Vincze | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>6D object pose estimation for unseen objects is essential in robotics but traditionally relies on trained models that require large datasets, high computational costs, and struggle to generalize. Zero-shot approaches eliminate the need for training but depend on pre-existing 3D object models, which are often impractical to obtain. To address this, we propose a language-guided few-shot 3D reconstruction method, reconstructing a 3D mesh from few input images. In the proposed pipeline, receives a set of input images and a language query. A combination of GroundingDINO and Segment Anything Model outputs segmented masks from which a sparse point cloud is reconstructed with VGGSfM. Subsequently, the mesh is reconstructed with the Gaussian Splatting method SuGAR. In a final cleaning step, artifacts are removed, resulting in the final 3D mesh of the queried object. We evaluate the method in terms of accuracy and quality of the geometry and texture. Furthermore, we study the impact of imaging conditions such as viewing angle, number of input images, and image overlap on 3D object reconstruction quality, efficiency, and computational scalability.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07190](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07190) |
| 245 | Dream to Manipulate: Compositional World Models Empowering Robot Imitation Learning with Imagination | Leonardo Barcellona,Andrii Zadaianchuk,Davide Allegro,Samuele Papa,Stefano Ghidoni,Efstratios Gavves | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>A world model provides an agent with a representation of its environment, enabling it to predict the causal consequences of its actions. Current world models typically cannot directly and explicitly imitate the actual environment in front of a robot, often resulting in unrealistic behaviors and hallucinations that make them unsuitable for real-world robotics applications. To overcome those challenges, we propose to rethink robot world models as learnable digital twins. We introduce DreMa, a new approach for constructing digital twins automatically using learned explicit representations of the real world and its dynamics, bridging the gap between traditional digital twins and world models. DreMa replicates the observed world and its structure by integrating Gaussian Splatting and physics simulators, allowing robots to imagine novel configurations of objects and to predict the future consequences of robot actions thanks to its compositionality. We leverage this capability to generate new data for imitation learning by applying equivariant transformations to a small set of demonstrations. Our evaluations across various settings demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and robustness by incrementing actions and object distributions, reducing the data needed to learn a policy and improving the generalization of the agents. As a highlight, we show that a real Franka Emika Panda robot, powered by DreMa's imagination, can successfully learn novel physical tasks from just a single example per task variation (one-shot policy learning).

| 244 | SplatFormer: Point Transformer for Robust 3D Gaussian Splatting | Yutong Chen,Marko Mihajlovic,Xiyi Chen,Yiming Wang,Sergey Prokudin,Siyu Tang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently transformed photorealistic reconstruction, achieving high visual fidelity and real-time performance. However, rendering quality significantly deteriorates when test views deviate from the camera angles used during training, posing a major challenge for applications in immersive free-viewpoint rendering and navigation. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 3DGS and related novel view synthesis methods under out-of-distribution (OOD) test camera scenarios. By creating diverse test cases with synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that most existing methods, including those incorporating various regularization techniques and data-driven priors, struggle to generalize effectively to OOD views. To address this limitation, we introduce SplatFormer, the first point transformer model specifically designed to operate on Gaussian splats. SplatFormer takes as input an initial 3DGS set optimized under limited training views and refines it in a single forward pass, effectively removing potential artifacts in OOD test views. To our knowledge, this is the first successful application of point transformers directly on 3DGS sets, surpassing the limitations of previous multi-scene training methods, which could handle only a restricted number of input views during inference. Our model significantly improves rendering quality under extreme novel views, achieving state-of-the-art performance in these challenging scenarios and outperforming various 3DGS regularization techniques, multi-scene models tailored for sparse view synthesis, and diffusion-based frameworks.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06390](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06390) |
| 243 | Frequency-Aware Density Control via Reparameterization for High-Quality Rendering of 3D Gaussian Splatting | Zhaojie Zeng,Yuesong Wang,Lili Ju,Tao Guan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>By adaptively controlling the density and generating more Gaussians in regions with high-frequency information, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) can better represent scene details. From the signal processing perspective, representing details usually needs more Gaussians with relatively smaller scales. However, 3DGS currently lacks an explicit constraint linking the density and scale of 3D Gaussians across the domain, leading to 3DGS using improper-scale Gaussians to express frequency information, resulting in the loss of accuracy. In this paper, we propose to establish a direct relation between density and scale through the reparameterization of the scaling parameters and ensure the consistency between them via explicit constraints (i.e., density responds well to changes in frequency). Furthermore, we develop a frequency-aware density control strategy, consisting of densification and deletion, to improve representation quality with fewer Gaussians. A dynamic threshold encourages densification in high-frequency regions, while a scale-based filter deletes Gaussians with improper scale. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07000](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07000) |

However, the limited hardware resources on today's mobile platforms hinder these applications, as they struggle to achieve real-time performance. In this paper, we propose SeeLe, a general framework designed to accelerate the 3DGS pipeline for resource-constrained mobile devices.  Specifically, we propose two GPU-oriented techniques: hybrid preprocessing and contribution-aware rasterization. Hybrid preprocessing alleviates the GPU compute and memory pressure by reducing the number of irrelevant Gaussians during rendering. The key is to combine our view-dependent scene representation with online filtering. Meanwhile, contribution-aware rasterization improves the GPU utilization at the rasterization stage by prioritizing Gaussians with high contributions while reducing computations for those with low contributions. Both techniques can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS pipelines with minimal fine-tuning. Collectively, our framework achieves 2.6$\\times$ speedup and 32.3\\% model reduction while achieving superior rendering quality compared to existing methods.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05168](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05168) |
| 241 | Hier-SLAM: Scaling-up Semantics in SLAM with a Hierarchically Categorical Gaussian Splatting | Boying Li,Zhixi Cai,Yuan-Fang Li,Ian Reid,Hamid Rezatofighi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose Hier-SLAM, a semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method featuring a novel hierarchical categorical representation, which enables accurate global 3D semantic mapping, scaling-up capability, and explicit semantic label prediction in the 3D world. The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Furthermore, we enhance the whole SLAM system, resulting in improved tracking and mapping performance. Our \\MethodName{} outperforms existing dense SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy, while achieving a 2x operation speed-up. Additionally, it achieves on-par semantic rendering performance compared to existing methods while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements. Rendering FPS impressively reaches 2,000 with semantic information and 3,000 without it. Most notably, it showcases the capability of handling the complex real-world scene with more than 500 semantic classes, highlighting its valuable scaling-up capability.

| 240 | GSplatVNM: Point-of-View Synthesis for Visual Navigation Models Using Gaussian Splatting | Kohei Honda,Takeshi Ishita,Yasuhiro Yoshimura,Ryo Yonetani | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper presents a novel approach to image-goal navigation by integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with Visual Navigation Models (VNMs), a method we refer to as GSplatVNM. VNMs offer a promising paradigm for image-goal navigation by guiding a robot through a sequence of point-of-view images without requiring metrical localization or environment-specific training. However, constructing a dense and traversable sequence of target viewpoints from start to goal remains a central challenge, particularly when the available image database is sparse. To address these challenges, we propose a 3DGS-based viewpoint synthesis framework for VNMs that synthesizes intermediate viewpoints to seamlessly bridge gaps in sparse data while significantly reducing storage overhead. Experimental results in a photorealistic simulator demonstrate that our approach not only enhances navigation efficiency but also exhibits robustness under varying levels of image database sparsity.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05152](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05152) |
| 239 | DirectTriGS: Triplane-based Gaussian Splatting Field Representation for 3D Generation | Xiaoliang Ju,Hongsheng Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present DirectTriGS, a novel framework designed for 3D object generation with Gaussian Splatting (GS). GS-based rendering for 3D content has gained considerable attention recently. However, there has been limited exploration in directly generating 3D Gaussians compared to traditional generative modeling approaches. The main challenge lies in the complex data structure of GS represented by discrete point clouds with multiple channels. To overcome this challenge, we propose employing the triplane representation, which allows us to represent Gaussian Splatting as an image-like continuous field. This representation effectively encodes both the geometry and texture information, enabling smooth transformation back to Gaussian point clouds and rendering into images by a TriRenderer, with only 2D supervisions. The proposed TriRenderer is fully differentiable, so that the rendering loss can supervise both texture and geometry encoding. Furthermore, the triplane representation can be compressed using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which can subsequently be utilized in latent diffusion to generate 3D objects. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed generation framework can produce high-quality 3D object geometry and rendering results in the text-to-3D task.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06900](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06900) |

Polyzos,Athanasios Bacharis,Saketh Madhuvarasu,Nikos Papanikolopoulos,Tara Javidi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian splatting (GS) along with its extensions and variants provides outstanding performance in real-time scene rendering while meeting reduced storage demands and computational efficiency. While the selection of 2D images capturing the scene of interest is crucial for the proper initialization and training of GS, hence markedly affecting the rendering performance, prior works rely on passively and typically densely selected 2D images. In contrast, this paper proposes `ActiveInitSplat', a novel framework for active selection of training images for proper initialization and training of GS. ActiveInitSplat relies on density and occupancy criteria of the resultant 3D scene representation from the selected 2D images, to ensure that the latter are captured from diverse viewpoints leading to better scene coverage and that the initialized Gaussian functions are well aligned with the actual 3D structure. Numerical tests on well-known simulated and real environments demonstrate the merits of ActiveInitSplat resulting in significant GS rendering performance improvement over passive GS baselines, in the widely adopted LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR metrics.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06859](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06859) |

To address this, we introduce Computational Alignment for Real-Time Gaussian Splatting SLAM (CaRtGS), a novel method enhancing the efficiency and quality of photorealistic scene reconstruction in real-time environments. Leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), CaRtGS achieves superior rendering quality and processing speed, which is crucial for scene photorealistic reconstruction. Our approach tackles computational misalignment in Gaussian Splatting SLAM (GS-SLAM) through an adaptive strategy that enhances optimization iterations, addresses long-tail optimization, and refines densification.

| 236 | Gaussian RBFNet: Gaussian Radial Basis Functions for Fast and Accurate Representation and Reconstruction of Neural Fields | Abdelaziz Bouzidi,Hamid Laga,Hazem Wannous | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Neural fields such as DeepSDF and Neural Radiance Fields have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from RGB images and videos. However, achieving high-quality representation, reconstruction, and rendering requires deep neural networks, which are slow to train and evaluate. Although several acceleration techniques have been proposed, they often trade off speed for memory. Gaussian splatting-based methods, on the other hand, accelerate the rendering time but remain costly in terms of training speed and memory needed to store the parameters of a large number of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce a novel neural representation that is fast, both at training and inference times, and lightweight. Our key observation is that the neurons used in traditional MLPs perform simple computations (a dot product followed by ReLU activation) and thus one needs to use either wide and deep MLPs or high-resolution and high-dimensional feature grids to parameterize complex nonlinear functions. We show in this paper that by replacing traditional neurons with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels, one can achieve highly accurate representation of 2D (RGB images), 3D (geometry), and 5D (radiance fields) signals with just a single layer of such neurons. The representation is highly parallelizable, operates on low-resolution feature grids, and is compact and memory-efficient. We demonstrate that the proposed novel representation can be trained for 3D geometry representation in less than 15 seconds and for novel view synthesis in less than 15 mins. At runtime, it can synthesize novel views at more than 60 fps without sacrificing quality.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06762](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06762) |

However, the complex and highly dynamic nature of traffic environments presents significant challenges in accurately rendering these scenes. In this paper, we introduce a novel 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) approach, which incorporates context and temporal deformation awareness to improve dynamic scene rendering. Specifically, we employ a 2D semantic segmentation foundation model to self-supervise the 4D semantic features of Gaussians, ensuring meaningful contextual embedding. Simultaneously, we track the temporal deformation of each Gaussian across adjacent frames. By aggregating and encoding both semantic and temporal deformation features, each Gaussian is equipped with cues for potential deformation compensation within 3D space, facilitating a more precise representation of dynamic scenes. Experimental results show that our method improves 4DGS's ability to capture fine details in dynamic scene rendering for autonomous driving and outperforms other self-supervised methods in 4D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Furthermore, CoDa-4DGS deforms semantic features with each Gaussian, enabling broader applications.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06744](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06744) |

However, the challenge of natural-looking object insertion, where the object's appearance seamlessly matches the scene, remains unsolved. In this work, we propose a method, dubbed D3DR, for inserting a 3DGS-parametrized object into 3DGS scenes while correcting its lighting, shadows, and other visual artifacts to ensure consistency, a problem that has not been successfully addressed before. We leverage advances in diffusion models, which, trained on real-world data, implicitly understand correct scene lighting. After inserting the object, we optimize a diffusion-based Delta Denoising Score (DDS)-inspired objective to adjust its 3D Gaussian parameters for proper lighting correction. Utilizing diffusion model personalization techniques to improve optimization quality, our approach ensures seamless object insertion and natural appearance. Finally, we demonstrate the method's effectiveness by comparing it to existing approaches, achieving 0.5 PSNR and 0.15 SSIM improvements in relighting quality.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06740](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06740) |

Recent advances leveraging implicit neural representation (INR) have achieved great progress by modeling coordinate-to-pixel mappings. However, the efficiency of these methods may suffer from repeated upsampling and decoding, while their reconstruction fidelity and quality are constrained by the intrinsic representational limitations of coordinate-based functions.

This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming upsampling and decoding, enabling extremely fast arbitrary-scale super-resolution.

| 232 | Introducing Unbiased Depth into 2D Gaussian Splatting for High-accuracy Surface Reconstruction | Xiaoming Peng,Yixin Yang,Yang Zhou,Hui Huang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has demonstrated superior geometry reconstruction quality than the popular 3DGS by using 2D surfels to approximate thin surfaces. However, it falls short when dealing with glossy surfaces, resulting in visible holes in these areas. We found the reflection discontinuity causes the issue. To fit the jump from diffuse to specular reflection at different viewing angles, depth bias is introduced in the optimized Gaussian primitives. To address that, we first replace the depth distortion loss in 2DGS with a novel depth convergence loss, which imposes a strong constraint on depth continuity. Then, we rectified the depth criterion in determining the actual surface, which fully accounts for all the intersecting Gaussians along the ray. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations across various datasets reveal that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality, with more complete and accurate surfaces than 2DGS.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06587](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06587) |

To address these limitations, we propose NexusSplats, an approach tailored for efficient and high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction under complex lighting and occlusion conditions. In particular, NexusSplats leverages a hierarchical light decoupling strategy that performs centralized appearance learning, efficiently and effectively decoupling varying lighting conditions. Furthermore, a structure-aware occlusion handling mechanism is developed, establishing a nexus between 3D and 2D structures for fine-grained occlusion handling.

The technique of 3D Gaussian Splatting and its variants incorporate the strengths of both primitive-based and volumetric representations, achieving superior rendering quality. While 3D Geometric Scattering (3DGS) and its variants have advanced the field of 3D representation, they fall short in capturing the stochastic properties of non-local structural information during the training process. Additionally, the initialisation of spherical functions in 3DGS-based methods often fails to engage higher-order terms in early training rounds, leading to unnecessary computational overhead as training progresses. Furthermore, current 3DGS-based approaches require training on higher resolution images to render higher resolution outputs, significantly increasing memory demands and prolonging training durations. We introduce StructGS, a framework that enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for improved novel-view synthesis in 3D reconstruction. StructGS innovatively incorporates a patch-based SSIM loss, dynamic spherical harmonics initialisation and a Multi-scale Residual Network (MSRN) to address the above-mentioned limitations, respectively.

However, in real-world, online robotic scenes where the number of views is limited given efficiency requirements, random view selection for 3DGS becomes impractical as views are often overlapping and redundant. We address this issue by proposing an end-to-end online training and active view selection pipeline, which enhances the performance of 3DGS in few-view robotics settings. We first elevate the performance of few-shot 3DGS with a novel semantic depth alignment method using Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) that we supplement with Pearson depth and surface normal loss to improve color and depth reconstruction of real-world scenes. We then extend FisherRF, a next-best-view selection method for 3DGS, to select views and touch poses based on depth uncertainty. We perform online view selection on a real robot system during live 3DGS training. We motivate our improvements to few-shot GS scenes, and extend depth-based FisherRF to them, where we demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements on challenging robot scenes.

While 2D vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in 2D VQA tasks, progress in the 3D domain has been significantly slower due to the complexity of 3D data and the high cost of manual annotations.

During experiments on multiple benchmarks, our approach outperforms both 3D models trained specifically for the task and previous 2D-LMM-based models utilizing only images (our setting), while achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art 3D LMMs that additionally utilize 3D inputs.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06271](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06271) |
| 225 | Occam's LGS: An Efficient Approach for Language Gaussian Splatting | Jiahuan Cheng,Jan-Nico Zaech,Luc Van Gool,Danda Pani Paudel | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>TL;DR: Gaussian Splatting is a widely adopted approach for 3D scene representation, offering efficient, high-quality reconstruction and rendering. A key reason for its success is the simplicity of representing scenes with sets of Gaussians, making it interpretable and adaptable. To enhance understanding beyond visual representation, recent approaches extend Gaussian Splatting with semantic vision-language features, enabling open-set tasks. Typically, these language features are aggregated from multiple 2D views, however, existing methods rely on cumbersome techniques, resulting in high computational costs and longer training times.  In this work, we show that the complicated pipelines for language 3D Gaussian Splatting are simply unnecessary. Instead, we follow a probabilistic formulation of Language Gaussian Splatting and apply Occam's razor to the task at hand, leading to a highly efficient weighted multi-view feature aggregation technique. Doing so offers us state-of-the-art results with a speed-up of two orders of magnitude without any compression, allowing for easy scene manipulation.

To address this challenge, we propose T-3DGS, a novel framework that robustly filters out transient distractors during 3D reconstruction using Gaussian Splatting. Our framework consists of two steps. First, we employ an unsupervised classification network that distinguishes transient objects from static scene elements by leveraging their distinct training dynamics within the reconstruction process. Second, we refine these initial detections by integrating an off-the-shelf segmentation method with a bidirectional tracking module, which together enhance boundary accuracy and temporal coherence. Evaluations on both sparsely and densely captured video datasets demonstrate that T-3DGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, enabling high-fidelity 3D reconstructions in challenging, real-world scenarios.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00155](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00155) |
| 223 | Video2BEV: Transforming Drone Videos to BEVs for Video-based Geo-localization | Hao Ju,Shaofei Huang,Si Liu,Zhedong Zheng | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Existing approaches to drone visual geo-localization predominantly adopt the image-based setting, where a single drone-view snapshot is matched with images from other platforms. Such task formulation, however, underutilizes the inherent video output of the drone and is sensitive to occlusions and viewpoint disparity. To address these limitations, we formulate a new video-based drone geo-localization task and propose the Video2BEV paradigm. This paradigm transforms the video into a Bird's Eye View (BEV), simplifying the subsequent \\textbf{inter-platform} matching process. In particular, we employ Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct a 3D scene and obtain the BEV projection. Different from the existing transform methods, \\eg, polar transform, our BEVs preserve more fine-grained details without significant distortion. To facilitate the discriminative \\textbf{intra-platform} representation learning, our Video2BEV paradigm also incorporates a diffusion-based module for generating hard negative samples. To validate our approach, we introduce UniV, a new video-based geo-localization dataset that extends the image-based University-1652 dataset. UniV features flight paths at $30^\\circ$ and $45^\\circ$ elevation angles with increased frame rates of up to 10 frames per second (FPS). Extensive experiments on the UniV dataset show that our Video2BEV paradigm achieves competitive recall rates and outperforms conventional video-based methods. Compared to other competitive methods, our proposed approach exhibits robustness at lower elevations with more occlusions.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13610](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13610) |
| 222 | ForestSplats: Deformable transient field for Gaussian Splatting in the Wild | Wongi Park,Myeongseok Nam,Siwon Kim,Sangwoo Jo,Soomok Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged, showing real-time rendering speeds and high-quality results in static scenes. Although 3D-GS shows effectiveness in static scenes, their performance significantly degrades in real-world environments due to transient objects, lighting variations, and diverse levels of occlusion. To tackle this, existing methods estimate occluders or transient elements by leveraging pre-trained models or integrating additional transient field pipelines. However, these methods still suffer from two defects: 1) Using semantic features from the Vision Foundation model (VFM) causes additional computational costs. 2) The transient field requires significant memory to handle transient elements with per-view Gaussians and struggles to define clear boundaries for occluders, solely relying on photometric errors. To address these problems, we propose ForestSplats, a novel approach that leverages the deformable transient field and a superpixel-aware mask to efficiently represent transient elements in the 2D scene across unconstrained image collections and effectively decompose static scenes from transient distractors without VFM. We designed the transient field to be deformable, capturing per-view transient elements. Furthermore, we introduce a superpixel-aware mask that clearly defines the boundaries of occluders by considering photometric errors and superpixels. Additionally, we propose uncertainty-aware densification to avoid generating Gaussians within the boundaries of occluders during densification. Through extensive experiments across several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that ForestSplats outperforms existing methods without VFM and shows significant memory efficiency in representing transient elements.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06179](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06179) |
| 221 | Feature-EndoGaussian: Feature Distilled Gaussian Splatting in Surgical Deformable Scene Reconstruction | Kai Li,Junhao Wang,William Han,Ding Zhao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has transformed clinical practice by reducing recovery times, minimizing complications, and enhancing precision. Nonetheless, MIS inherently relies on indirect visualization and precise instrument control, posing unique challenges. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled real-time surgical scene understanding through techniques such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, with scene reconstruction emerging as a key element for enhanced intraoperative guidance. Although neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have been explored for this purpose, their substantial data requirements and slow rendering inhibit real-time performance. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a more efficient alternative, achieving state-of-the-art performance in dynamic surgical scene reconstruction. In this work, we introduce Feature-EndoGaussian (FEG), an extension of 3DGS that integrates 2D segmentation cues into 3D rendering to enable real-time semantic and scene reconstruction. By leveraging pretrained segmentation foundation models, FEG incorporates semantic feature distillation within the Gaussian deformation framework, thereby enhancing both reconstruction fidelity and segmentation accuracy. On the EndoNeRF dataset, FEG achieves superior performance (SSIM of 0.97, PSNR of 39.08, and LPIPS of 0.03) compared to leading methods. Additionally, on the EndoVis18 dataset, FEG demonstrates competitive class-wise segmentation metrics while balancing model size and real-time performance.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06161](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06161) |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent.

| 219 | GSV3D: Gaussian Splatting-based Geometric Distillation with Stable Video Diffusion for Single-Image 3D Object Generation | Ye Tao,Jiawei Zhang,Yahao Shi,Dongqing Zou,Bin Zhou | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Image-based 3D generation has vast applications in robotics and gaming, where high-quality, diverse outputs and consistent 3D representations are crucial. However, existing methods have limitations: 3D diffusion models are limited by dataset scarcity and the absence of strong pre-trained priors, while 2D diffusion-based approaches struggle with geometric consistency. We propose a method that leverages 2D diffusion models' implicit 3D reasoning ability while ensuring 3D consistency via Gaussian-splatting-based geometric distillation. Specifically, the proposed Gaussian Splatting Decoder enforces 3D consistency by transforming SV3D latent outputs into an explicit 3D representation. Unlike SV3D, which only relies on implicit 2D representations for video generation, Gaussian Splatting explicitly encodes spatial and appearance attributes, enabling multi-view consistency through geometric constraints. These constraints correct view inconsistencies, ensuring robust geometric consistency. As a result, our approach simultaneously generates high-quality, multi-view-consistent images and accurate 3D models, providing a scalable solution for single-image-based 3D generation and bridging the gap between 2D Diffusion diversity and 3D structural coherence. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art multi-view consistency and strong generalization across diverse datasets. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06136](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06136) |
| 218 | SecureGS: Boosting the Security and Fidelity of 3D Gaussian Splatting Steganography | Xuanyu Zhang,Jiarui Meng,Zhipei Xu,Shuzhou Yang,Yanmin Wu,Ronggang Wang,Jian Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a premier method for 3D representation due to its real-time rendering and high-quality outputs, underscoring the critical need to protect the privacy of 3D assets. Traditional NeRF steganography methods fail to address the explicit nature of 3DGS since its point cloud files are publicly accessible. Existing GS steganography solutions mitigate some issues but still struggle with reduced rendering fidelity, increased computational demands, and security flaws, especially in the security of the geometric structure of the visualized point cloud. To address these demands, we propose a SecureGS, a secure and efficient 3DGS steganography framework inspired by Scaffold-GS's anchor point design and neural decoding. SecureGS uses a hybrid decoupled Gaussian encryption mechanism to embed offsets, scales, rotations, and RGB attributes of the hidden 3D Gaussian points in anchor point features, retrievable only by authorized users through privacy-preserving neural networks. To further enhance security, we propose a density region-aware anchor growing and pruning strategy that adaptively locates optimal hiding regions without exposing hidden information. Extensive experiments show that SecureGS significantly surpasses existing GS steganography methods in rendering fidelity, speed, and security.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06118](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06118) |
| 217 | Bayesian Fields: Task-driven Open-Set Semantic Gaussian Splatting | Dominic Maggio,Luca Carlone | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Open-set semantic mapping requires (i) determining the correct granularity to represent the scene (e.g., how should objects be defined), and (ii) fusing semantic knowledge across multiple 2D observations into an overall 3D reconstruction -ideally with a high-fidelity yet low-memory footprint. While most related works bypass the first issue by grouping together primitives with similar semantics (according to some manually tuned threshold), we recognize that the object granularity is task-dependent, and develop a task-driven semantic mapping approach. To address the second issue, current practice is to average visual embedding vectors over multiple views. Instead, we show the benefits of using a probabilistic approach based on the properties of the underlying visual-language foundation model, and leveraging Bayesian updating to aggregate multiple observations of the scene. The result is Bayesian Fields, a task-driven and probabilistic approach for open-set semantic mapping. To enable high-fidelity objects and a dense scene representation, Bayesian Fields uses 3D Gaussians which we cluster into task-relevant objects, allowing for both easy 3D object extraction and reduced memory usage. We release Bayesian Fields open-source at https: //github.com/MIT-SPARK/Bayesian-Fields.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05949](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05949) |
| 216 | D2GV: Deformable 2D Gaussian Splatting for Video Representation in 400FPS | Mufan Liu,Qi Yang,Miaoran Zhao,He Huang,Le Yang,Zhu Li,Yiling Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful approach for video representation, offering versatility across tasks such as compression and inpainting. However, their implicit formulation limits both interpretability and efficacy, undermining their practicality as a comprehensive solution. We propose a novel video representation based on deformable 2D Gaussian splatting, dubbed D2GV, which aims to achieve three key objectives: 1) improved efficiency while delivering superior quality; 2) enhanced scalability and interpretability; and 3) increased friendliness for downstream tasks. Specifically, we initially divide the video sequence into fixed-length Groups of Pictures (GoP) to allow parallel training and linear scalability with video length. For each GoP, D2GV represents video frames by applying differentiable rasterization to 2D Gaussians, which are deformed from a canonical space into their corresponding timestamps. Notably, leveraging efficient CUDA-based rasterization, D2GV converges fast and decodes at speeds exceeding 400 FPS, while delivering quality that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art INRs. Moreover, we incorporate a learnable pruning and quantization strategy to streamline D2GV into a more compact representation. We demonstrate D2GV's versatility in tasks including video interpolation, inpainting and denoising, underscoring its potential as a promising solution for video representation. Code is available at: https://github.com/Evan-sudo/D2GV.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05600](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05600) |

Furthermore, it leverages LiDAR point clouds to initialize 3DGS, providing a denser and more reliable starting points compared to sparse SfM points. In scene rendering, the framework augments standard image-based supervision with depth maps generated from LiDAR projections, ensuring an accurate scene representation in both geometry and photometry.

| 214 | Self-Modeling Robots by Photographing | Kejun Hu,Peng Yu,Ning Tan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Self-modeling enables robots to build task-agnostic models of their morphology and kinematics based on data that can be automatically collected, with minimal human intervention and prior information, thereby enhancing machine intelligence. Recent research has highlighted the potential of data-driven technology in modeling the morphology and kinematics of robots. However, existing self-modeling methods suffer from either low modeling quality or excessive data acquisition costs. Beyond morphology and kinematics, texture is also a crucial component of robots, which is challenging to model and remains unexplored. In this work, a high-quality, texture-aware, and link-level method is proposed for robot self-modeling. We utilize three-dimensional (3D) Gaussians to represent the static morphology and texture of robots, and cluster the 3D Gaussians to construct neural ellipsoid bones, whose deformations are controlled by the transformation matrices generated by a kinematic neural network. The 3D Gaussians and kinematic neural network are trained using data pairs composed of joint angles, camera parameters and multi-view images without depth information. By feeding the kinematic neural network with joint angles, we can utilize the well-trained model to describe the corresponding morphology, kinematics and texture of robots at the link level, and render robot images from different perspectives with the aid of 3D Gaussian splatting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the established model can be exploited to perform downstream tasks such as motion planning and inverse kinematics.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05398](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05398) |

This innovative approach, characterized by the use of millions of learnable 3D Gaussians, represents a significant departure from mainstream neural radiance field approaches, which predominantly use implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values. 3D GS, with its explicit scene representation and differentiable rendering algorithm, not only promises real-time rendering capability but also introduces unprecedented levels of editability. This positions 3D GS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present paper, we provide the first systematic overview of the recent developments and critical contributions in the domain of 3D GS. We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the emergence of 3D GS, laying the groundwork for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By enabling unprecedented rendering speed, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications, ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility. The survey concludes by identifying current challenges and suggesting potential avenues for future research.

However, the reconstructed scenes still lack "liveliness," a key component for creating engaging 3D experiences. Recently, novel video diffusion models generate realistic videos with complex motion and enable animations of 2D images, however they cannot naively be used to animate 3D scenes as they lack multi-view consistency. To breathe life into the static world, we propose Gaussians2Life, a method for animating parts of high-quality 3D scenes in a Gaussian Splatting representation. Our key idea is to leverage powerful video diffusion models as the generative component of our model and to combine these with a robust technique to lift 2D videos into meaningful 3D motion. We find that, in contrast to prior work, this enables realistic animations of complex, pre-existing 3D scenes and further enables the animation of a large variety of object classes, while related work is mostly focused on prior-based character animation, or single 3D objects. Our model enables the creation of consistent, immersive 3D experiences for arbitrary scenes.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19233](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19233) |

A critical issue is the camera motion blur caused by movement during exposure, which hinders accurate 3D scene reconstruction. In this study, we propose CoMoGaussian, a Continuous Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting that reconstructs precise 3D scenes from motion-blurred images while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Considering the complex motion patterns inherent in real-world camera movements, we predict continuous camera trajectories using neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To ensure accurate modeling, we employ rigid body transformations, preserving the shape and size of the object but rely on the discrete integration of sampled frames. To better approximate the continuous nature of motion blur, we introduce a continuous motion refinement (CMR) transformation that refines rigid transformations by incorporating additional learnable parameters. By revisiting fundamental camera theory and leveraging advanced neural ODE techniques, we achieve precise modeling of continuous camera trajectories, leading to improved reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on benchmark datasets, which include a wide range of motion blur scenarios, from moderate to extreme blur.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05332](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05332) |

The dynamic head Gaussian model is trained based on the FLAME parameterized model. Each Gaussian splat is embedded within the FLAME mesh to achieve mesh-based animation of the Gaussian model. Before training, our selection strategy calculates the 3D Gaussian splat to be optimized in each frame. The parameters of these 3D Gaussian splats are optimized in the training of each frame, while those of the other splats are frozen. This means that the splats participating in the optimization process differ in each frame, to improve the realism of fine details. Compared with network-based methods, our method achieves better results with shorter training time. Compared with mesh-based methods, our method produces more realistic details within the same training time. Additionally, the ablation experiment confirms that our method effectively enhances the quality of details.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05196](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05196) |

However, manipulating granular materials such as beans, nuts, and rice, remains challenging due to the intricate physics of particle interactions, high-dimensional and partially observable state, inability to visually track individual particles in a pile, and the computational demands of accurate dynamics prediction. Current deep latent dynamics models often struggle to generalize in granular material manipulation due to a lack of inductive biases. In this work, we propose a novel approach that learns a visual dynamics model over Gaussian splatting representations of scenes and leverages this model for manipulating granular media via Model-Predictive Control. Our method enables efficient optimization for complex manipulation tasks on piles of granular media. We evaluate our approach in both simulated and real-world settings, demonstrating its ability to solve unseen planning tasks and generalize to new environments in a zero-shot transfer. We also show significant prediction and manipulation performance improvements compared to existing granular media manipulation methods.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09740](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09740) |

Recently introduced Gaussian Splats efficiently model object geometry, but lack persistent state estimation for task-oriented manipulation. We present Persistent Object Gaussian Splat (POGS), a system that embeds semantics, self-supervised visual features, and object grouping features into a compact representation that can be continuously updated to estimate the pose of scanned objects. POGS updates object states without requiring expensive rescanning or prior CAD models of objects. After an initial multi-view scene capture and training phase, POGS uses a single stereo camera to integrate depth estimates along with self-supervised vision encoder features for object pose estimation. POGS supports grasping, reorientation, and natural language-driven manipulation by refining object pose estimates, facilitating sequential object reset operations with human-induced object perturbations and tool servoing, where robots recover tool pose despite tool perturbations of up to 30\xc2\xb0. POGS achieves up to 12 consecutive successful object resets and recovers from 80% of in-grasp tool perturbations.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05189](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05189) |

Despite recent progress, these tasks are often addressed independently, with GS-based rendering methods struggling under diverse light conditions and failing to produce accurate surfaces, while GS-based reconstruction methods frequently compromise rendering quality. This raises a central question: must rendering and reconstruction always involve a trade-off? To address this, we propose MGSR, a 2D/3D Mutual-boosted Gaussian splatting for Surface Reconstruction that enhances both rendering quality and 3D reconstruction accuracy. MGSR introduces two branches--one based on 2D-GS and the other on 3D-GS. The 2D-GS branch excels in surface reconstruction, providing precise geometry information to the 3D-GS branch. Leveraging this geometry, the 3D-GS branch employs a geometry-guided illumination decomposition module that captures reflected and transmitted components, enabling realistic rendering under varied light conditions. Using the transmitted component as supervision, the 2D-GS branch also achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction. Throughout the optimization process, the 2D-GS and 3D-GS branches undergo alternating optimization, providing mutual supervision. Prior to this, each branch completes an independent warm-up phase, with an early stopping strategy implemented to reduce computational costs. We evaluate MGSR on a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, at both object and scene levels, demonstrating strong performance in rendering and surface reconstruction.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05182](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05182) |

Existing single RGB-based methods often compromise accuracy due to their reliance on initial pose estimates and susceptibility to rotational ambiguity, while approaches requiring depth sensors or multi-view setups incur significant deployment costs. To address these limitations, we introduce SplatPose, a novel framework that synergizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with a dual-branch neural architecture to achieve high-precision pose estimation using only a single RGB image. Central to our approach is the Dual-Attention Ray Scoring Network (DARS-Net), which innovatively decouples positional and angular alignment through geometry-domain attention mechanisms, explicitly modeling directional dependencies to mitigate rotational ambiguity. Additionally, a coarse-to-fine optimization pipeline progressively refines pose estimates by aligning dense 2D features between query images and 3DGS-synthesized views, effectively correcting feature misalignment and depth errors from sparse ray sampling. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SplatPose achieves state-of-the-art 6-DoF pose estimation accuracy in single RGB settings, rivaling approaches that depend on depth or multi-view images.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05174](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05174) |

Much research has been focused on reducing its storage requirements and memory footprint. However, the needs to compress and transmit the 3DGS representation to the remote side are overlooked. This new application calls for rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression. How to quantize and entropy encode sparse Gaussian primitives in the 3D space remains largely unexplored. Few early attempts resort to the hyperprior framework from learned image compression. But, they fail to utilize fully the inter and intra correlation inherent in Gaussian primitives. Built on ScaffoldGS, this work, termed CAT-3DGS, introduces a context-adaptive triplane approach to their rate-distortion-optimized coding. It features multi-scale triplanes, oriented according to the principal axes of Gaussian primitives in the 3D space, to capture their inter correlation (i.e. spatial correlation) for spatial autoregressive coding in the projected 2D planes. With these triplanes serving as the hyperprior, we further perform channel-wise autoregressive coding to leverage the intra correlation within each individual Gaussian primitive. Our CAT-3DGS incorporates a view frequency-aware masking mechanism. It actively skips from coding those Gaussian primitives that potentially have little impact on the rendering quality. When trained end-to-end to strike a good rate-distortion trade-off, our CAT-3DGS achieves the state-of-the-art compression performance on the commonly used real-world datasets.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00357](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00357) |
| 204 | Generative Densification: Learning to Densify Gaussians for High-Fidelity Generalizable 3D Reconstruction | Seungtae Nam,Xiangyu Sun,Gyeongjin Kang,Younggeun Lee,Seungjun Oh,Eunbyung Park | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Generalized feed-forward Gaussian models have achieved significant progress in sparse-view 3D reconstruction by leveraging prior knowledge from large multi-view datasets. However, these models often struggle to represent high-frequency details due to the limited number of Gaussians. While the densification strategy used in per-scene 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) optimization can be adapted to the feed-forward models, it may not be ideally suited for generalized scenarios. In this paper, we propose Generative Densification, an efficient and generalizable method to densify Gaussians generated by feed-forward models. Unlike the 3D-GS densification strategy, which iteratively splits and clones raw Gaussian parameters, our method up-samples feature representations from the feed-forward models and generates their corresponding fine Gaussians in a single forward pass, leveraging the embedded prior knowledge for enhanced generalization. Experimental results on both object-level and scene-level reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with comparable or smaller model sizes, achieving notable improvements in representing fine details.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06234](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06234) |

However, reconstructing dynamic scenes such as complex human performances with long durations remains challenging. Prior efforts fall short of modeling a long-term sequence with drastic motions, frequent topology changes or interactions with props, and resort to segmenting the whole sequence into groups of frames that are processed independently, which undermines temporal stability and thereby leads to an unpleasant viewing experience and inefficient storage footprint. In view of this, we introduce EvolvingGS, a two-stage strategy that first deforms the Gaussian model to coarsely align with the target frame, and then refines it with minimal point addition/subtraction, particularly in fast-changing areas. Owing to the flexibility of the incrementally evolving representation, our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both per-frame and temporal quality metrics while maintaining fast rendering through its purely explicit representation. Moreover, by exploiting temporal coherence between successive frames, we propose a simple yet effective compression algorithm that achieves over 50x compression rate. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and challenging custom datasets demonstrate that our method significantly advances the state-of-the-art in dynamic scene reconstruction, particularly for extended sequences with complex human performances.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05162](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05162) |

Most existing methods, however, rely on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth for supervision, which are often difficult to be obtained in industrial applications and are sensitive to noise inputs. We propose viewing CAD reconstruction as a specific instance of sparse-view 3D reconstruction to overcome these limitations. While this reformulation offers a promising perspective, existing 3D reconstruction methods typically require natural images and corresponding camera poses as inputs, which introduces two major significant challenges: (1) modality discrepancy between CAD sketches and natural images, and (2) difficulty of accurate camera pose estimation for CAD sketches. To solve these issues, we first transform the CAD sketches into representations resembling natural images and extract corresponding masks. Next, we manually calculate the camera poses for the orthographic views to ensure accurate alignment within the 3D coordinate system. Finally, we employ a customized sparse-view 3D reconstruction method to achieve high-quality reconstructions from aligned orthographic views. By leveraging raster CAD sketches for self-supervision, our approach eliminates the reliance on vector CAD sketches and 3D ground truth. Experiments on the Sub-Fusion360 dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms previous approaches in CAD reconstruction performance and exhibits strong robustness to noisy inputs.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05161](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05161) |
| 201 | Taming Video Diffusion Prior with Scene-Grounding Guidance for 3D Gaussian Splatting from Sparse Inputs | Yingji Zhong,Zhihao Li,Dave Zhenyu Chen,Lanqing Hong,Dan Xu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Despite recent successes in novel view synthesis using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), modeling scenes with sparse inputs remains a challenge. In this work, we address two critical yet overlooked issues in real-world sparse-input modeling: extrapolation and occlusion. To tackle these issues, we propose to use a reconstruction by generation pipeline that leverages learned priors from video diffusion models to provide plausible interpretations for regions outside the field of view or occluded. However, the generated sequences exhibit inconsistencies that do not fully benefit subsequent 3DGS modeling. To address the challenge of inconsistencies, we introduce a novel scene-grounding guidance based on rendered sequences from an optimized 3DGS, which tames the diffusion model to generate consistent sequences. This guidance is training-free and does not require any fine-tuning of the diffusion model. To facilitate holistic scene modeling, we also propose a trajectory initialization method. It effectively identifies regions that are outside the field of view and occluded. We further design a scheme tailored for 3DGS optimization with generated sequences. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves upon the baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05082](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05082) |
| 200 | GSPR: Multimodal Place Recognition Using 3D Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Driving | Zhangshuo Qi,Junyi Ma,Jingyi Xu,Zijie Zhou,Luqi Cheng,Guangming Xiong | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Place recognition is a crucial component that enables autonomous vehicles to obtain localization results in GPS-denied environments. In recent years, multimodal place recognition methods have gained increasing attention. They overcome the weaknesses of unimodal sensor systems by leveraging complementary information from different modalities. However, most existing methods explore cross-modality correlations through feature-level or descriptor-level fusion, suffering from a lack of interpretability. Conversely, the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting provides a new perspective on multimodal fusion by harmonizing different modalities into an explicit scene representation. In this paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based multimodal place recognition network dubbed GSPR. It explicitly combines multi-view RGB images and LiDAR point clouds into a spatio-temporally unified scene representation with the proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. A network composed of 3D graph convolution and transformer is designed to extract spatio-temporal features and global descriptors from the Gaussian scenes for place recognition. Extensive evaluations on three datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively leverage complementary strengths of both multi-view cameras and LiDAR, achieving SOTA place recognition performance while maintaining solid generalization ability. Our open-source code will be released at https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/GSPR.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00299](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00299) |

As model size grows, however, slow encoding and decoding speed and high memory consumption hinder its application in practice. To address these limitations, we propose a new video representation and compression method based on 2D Gaussian Splatting to efficiently handle video data. Our proposed deformable 2D Gaussian Splatting dynamically adapts the transformation of 2D Gaussians at each frame, significantly reducing memory cost. Equipped with a multi-plane-based spatiotemporal encoder and a lightweight decoder, it predicts changes in color, coordinates, and shape of initialized Gaussians, given the time step. By leveraging temporal gradients, our model effectively captures temporal redundancy at negligible cost, significantly enhancing video representation efficiency. Our method reduces GPU memory usage by up to 78.4%, and significantly expedites video processing, achieving 5.5x faster training and 12.5x faster decoding compared to the state-of-the-art NeRV methods.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04333](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04333) |
| 198 | S2Gaussian: Sparse-View Super-Resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting | Yecong Wan,Mingwen Shao,Yuanshuo Cheng,Wangmeng Zuo | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we aim ambitiously for a realistic yet challenging problem, namely, how to reconstruct high-quality 3D scenes from sparse low-resolution views that simultaneously suffer from deficient perspectives and clarity. Whereas existing methods only deal with either sparse views or low-resolution observations, they fail to handle such hybrid and complicated scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel Sparse-view Super-resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, dubbed S2Gaussian, that can reconstruct structure-accurate and detail-faithful 3D scenes with only sparse and low-resolution views. The S2Gaussian operates in a two-stage fashion. In the first stage, we initially optimize a low-resolution Gaussian representation with depth regularization and densify it to initialize the high-resolution Gaussians through a tailored Gaussian Shuffle Split operation. In the second stage, we refine the high-resolution Gaussians with the super-resolved images generated from both original sparse views and pseudo-views rendered by the low-resolution Gaussians. In which a customized blur-free inconsistency modeling scheme and a 3D robust optimization strategy are elaborately designed to mitigate multi-view inconsistency and eliminate erroneous updates caused by imperfect supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior results and in particular establishing new state-of-the-art performances with more consistent geometry and finer details.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04314](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04314) |
| 197 | Surgical Gaussian Surfels: Highly Accurate Real-time Surgical Scene Rendering | Idris O. Sunmola,Zhenjun Zhao,Samuel Schmidgall,Yumeng Wang,Paul Maria Scheikl,Axel Krieger | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Accurate geometric reconstruction of deformable tissues in monocular endoscopic video remains a fundamental challenge in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. Although recent volumetric and point primitive methods based on neural radiance fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian primitives have efficiently rendered surgical scenes, they still struggle with handling artifact-free tool occlusions and preserving fine anatomical details. These limitations stem from unrestricted Gaussian scaling and insufficient surface alignment constraints during reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce Surgical Gaussian Surfels (SGS), which transforms anisotropic point primitives into surface-aligned elliptical splats by constraining the scale component of the Gaussian covariance matrix along the view-aligned axis. We predict accurate surfel motion fields using a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) coupled with locality constraints to handle complex tissue deformations. We use homodirectional view-space positional gradients to capture fine image details by splitting Gaussian Surfels in over-reconstructed regions. In addition, we define surface normals as the direction of the steepest density change within each Gaussian surfel primitive, enabling accurate normal estimation without requiring monocular normal priors. We evaluate our method on two in-vivo surgical datasets, where it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in surface geometry, normal map quality, and rendering efficiency, while remaining competitive in real-time rendering performance. We make our code available at https://github.com/aloma85/SurgicalGaussianSurfels</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04079](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04079) |
| 196 | Beyond Existance: Fulfill 3D Reconstructed Scenes with Pseudo Details | Yifei Gao,Jun Huang,Lei Wang,Ruiting Dai,Jun Cheng | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has significantly advanced 3D reconstruction by providing high fidelity and fast training speeds across various scenarios. While recent efforts have mainly focused on improving model structures to compress data volume or reduce artifacts during zoom-in and zoom-out operations, they often overlook an underlying issue: training sampling deficiency. In zoomed-in views, Gaussian primitives can appear unregulated and distorted due to their dilation limitations and the insufficient availability of scale-specific training samples. Consequently, incorporating pseudo-details that ensure the completeness and alignment of the scene becomes essential. In this paper, we introduce a new training method that integrates diffusion models and multi-scale training using pseudo-ground-truth data. This approach not only notably mitigates the dilation and zoomed-in artifacts but also enriches reconstructed scenes with precise details out of existing scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks and extends the capabilities of 3D reconstruction beyond training datasets.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04037](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04037) |

However, existing methods primarily focus on embedding compressed CLIP features to 3D Gaussians, suffering from low object segmentation accuracy and lack spatial reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose GaussianGraph, a novel framework that enhances 3DGS-based scene understanding by integrating adaptive semantic clustering and scene graph generation. We introduce a "Control-Follow" clustering strategy, which dynamically adapts to scene scale and feature distribution, avoiding feature compression and significantly improving segmentation accuracy. Additionally, we enrich scene representation by integrating object attributes and spatial relations extracted from 2D foundation models. To address inaccuracies in spatial relationships, we propose 3D correction modules that filter implausible relations through spatial consistency verification, ensuring reliable scene graph construction. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that GaussianGraph outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic segmentation and object grounding tasks, providing a robust solution for complex scene understanding and interaction.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04034](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04034) |

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising policy training paradigm. However existing RL methods suffer from high sample complexity, poor sim-to-real transfer, and limited runtime adaptability to navigation scenarios not seen during training. These problems are particularly challenging for drones, with complex nonlinear and unstable dynamics, and strong dynamic coupling between control and perception. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with differentiable deep reinforcement learning (DDRL) to train vision-based drone navigation policies. By leveraging high-fidelity 3D scene representations and differentiable simulation, our method improves sample efficiency and sim-to-real transfer. Additionally, we incorporate a Context-aided Estimator Network (CENet) to adapt to environmental variations at runtime. Moreover, by curriculum training in a mixture of different surrounding environments, we achieve in-task generalization, the ability to solve new instances of a task not seen during training. Drone hardware experiments demonstrate our method's high training efficiency compared to state-of-the-art RL methods, zero shot sim-to-real transfer for real robot deployment without fine tuning, and ability to adapt to new instances within the same task class (e.g. to fly through a gate at different locations with different distractors in the environment).</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03984](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03984) |
| 193 | LensDFF: Language-enhanced Sparse Feature Distillation for Efficient Few-Shot Dexterous Manipulation | Qian Feng,David S. Martinez Lema,Jianxiang Feng,Zhaopeng Chen,Alois Knoll | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Learning dexterous manipulation from few-shot demonstrations is a significant yet challenging problem for advanced, human-like robotic systems. Dense distilled feature fields have addressed this challenge by distilling rich semantic features from 2D visual foundation models into the 3D domain. However, their reliance on neural rendering models such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian Splatting results in high computational costs. In contrast, previous approaches based on sparse feature fields either suffer from inefficiencies due to multi-view dependencies and extensive training or lack sufficient grasp dexterity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Language-ENhanced Sparse Distilled Feature Field (LensDFF), which efficiently distills view-consistent 2D features onto 3D points using our novel language-enhanced feature fusion strategy, thereby enabling single-view few-shot generalization. Based on LensDFF, we further introduce a few-shot dexterous manipulation framework that integrates grasp primitives into the demonstrations to generate stable and highly dexterous grasps. Moreover, we present a real2sim grasp evaluation pipeline for efficient grasp assessment and hyperparameter tuning. Through extensive simulation experiments based on the real2sim pipeline and real-world experiments, our approach achieves competitive grasping performance, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03890](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03890) |

Motion blur is prevalent in real-world dynamic video capture, especially due to human movements in 3D human avatar modeling. Existing methods either (1) assume sharp image inputs, failing to address the detail loss introduced by motion blur, or (2) mainly consider blur by camera movements, neglecting the human motion blur which is more common in animatable avatars. Our proposed approach integrates a human movement-based motion blur model into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly modeling human motion trajectories during exposure time, we jointly optimize the trajectories and 3D Gaussians to reconstruct sharp, high-quality human avatars. We employ a pose-dependent fusion mechanism to distinguish moving body regions, optimizing both blurred and sharp areas effectively. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in rendering quality and quantitative metrics, producing sharp avatar reconstructions and enabling real-time rendering under challenging motion blur conditions.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13335](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13335) |

However, recent methods often struggle to maintain local consistency in color and texture throughout stylized scenes, which is essential for maintaining aesthetic coherence. To solve this problem, this paper introduces ArtNVG, an innovative 3D stylization framework that efficiently generates stylized 3D scenes by leveraging reference style images. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), ArtNVG achieves rapid optimization and rendering while upholding high reconstruction quality. Our framework realizes high-quality 3D stylization by incorporating two pivotal techniques: Content-Style Separated Control and Attention-based Neighboring-View Alignment. Content-Style Separated Control uses the CSGO model and the Tile ControlNet to decouple the content and style control, reducing risks of information leakage. Concurrently, Attention-based Neighboring-View Alignment ensures consistency of local colors and textures across neighboring views, significantly improving visual quality. Extensive experiments validate that ArtNVG surpasses existing methods, delivering superior results in content preservation, style alignment, and local consistency.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18783](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18783) |

With vision-based navigation, when combined with pre-operative imaging data as priors, it is possible to recover position and pose of the endoscope without the need of additional sensors. In practice, however, aligning pre-operative and intra-operative domains is complicated by significant texture differences. Although methods such as style transfer can be used to address this issue, they require large datasets from both source and target domains with prolonged training times. This paper proposes an efficient domain transfer method based on stylized Gaussian splatting, only requiring a few of real images (10 images) with very fast training time. Specifically, the transfer process includes two phases. In the first phase, the 3D models reconstructed from CT scans are represented as differential Gaussian point clouds. In the second phase, only color appearance related parameters are optimized to transfer the style and preserve the visual content. A novel structure consistency loss is applied to latent features and depth levels to enhance the stability of the transferred images. Detailed validation was performed to demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed method compared to that of the current state-of-the-art, highlighting the potential for intra-operative surgical navigation.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10860](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10860) |

Bagdasarian,Paul Knoll,Yi-Hsin Li,Florian Barthel,Anna Hilsmann,Peter Eisert,Wieland Morgenstern | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a cutting-edge technique for real-time radiance field rendering, offering state-of-the-art performance in terms of both quality and speed. 3DGS models a scene as a collection of three-dimensional Gaussians, with additional attributes optimized to conform to the scene's geometric and visual properties. Despite its advantages in rendering speed and image fidelity, 3DGS is limited by its significant storage and memory demands. These high demands make 3DGS impractical for mobile devices or headsets, reducing its applicability in important areas of computer graphics. To address these challenges and advance the practicality of 3DGS, this survey provides a comprehensive and detailed examination of compression and compaction techniques developed to make 3DGS more efficient. We classify existing methods into two categories: compression, which focuses on reducing file size, and compaction, which aims to minimize the number of Gaussians. Both methods aim to maintain or improve quality, each by minimizing its respective attribute: file size for compression and Gaussian count for compaction. We introduce the basic mathematical concepts underlying the analyzed methods, as well as key implementation details and design choices. Our report thoroughly discusses similarities and differences among the methods, as well as their respective advantages and disadvantages. We establish a consistent framework for comparing the surveyed methods based on key performance metrics and datasets. Specifically, since these methods have been developed in parallel and over a short period of time, currently, no comprehensive comparison exists.

Consequently, thermal infrared images are employed to reconstruct 3D models that accurately reflect the temperature distribution of a scene, aiding in applications such as building monitoring and energy management. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on static 3D reconstruction for a single time period, overlooking the impact of environmental factors on thermal radiation and failing to predict or analyze temperature variations over time. To address these challenges, we propose the NTR-Gaussian method, which treats temperature as a form of thermal radiation, incorporating elements like convective heat transfer and radiative heat dissipation. Our approach utilizes neural networks to predict thermodynamic parameters such as emissivity, convective heat transfer coefficient, and heat capacity. By integrating these predictions, we can accurately forecast thermal temperatures at various times throughout a nighttime scene. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic dataset specifically for nighttime thermal imagery. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that NTR-Gaussian significantly outperforms comparison methods in thermal reconstruction, achieving a predicted temperature error within 1 degree Celsius.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03115](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03115) |

Over the past few years, the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has made significant progress in rendering quality but behaves poorly in run-time performance due to the low efficiency of volumetric rendering. Recently, methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown great potential in fast training and real-time rendering. However, they still suffer from artifacts caused by inaccurate geometry. To address these problems, we propose 2DGS-Avatar, a novel approach based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) for modeling animatable clothed avatars with high-fidelity and fast training performance. Given monocular RGB videos as input, our method generates an avatar that can be driven by poses and rendered in real-time. Compared to 3DGS-based methods, our 2DGS-Avatar retains the advantages of fast training and rendering while also capturing detailed, dynamic, and photo-realistic appearances.

| 184 | Abstract Rendering: Computing All that is Seen in Gaussian Splat Scenes | Yangge Li,Chenxi Ji,Xiangru Zhong,Huan Zhang,Sayan Mitra | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce abstract rendering, a method for computing a set of images by rendering a scene from a continuously varying range of camera positions. The resulting abstract image-which encodes an infinite collection of possible renderings-is represented using constraints on the image matrix, enabling rigorous uncertainty propagation through the rendering process. This capability is particularly valuable for the formal verification of vision-based autonomous systems and other safety-critical applications. Our approach operates on Gaussian splat scenes, an emerging representation in computer vision and robotics. We leverage efficient piecewise linear bound propagation to abstract fundamental rendering operations, while addressing key challenges that arise in matrix inversion and depth sorting-two operations not directly amenable to standard approximations. To handle these, we develop novel linear relational abstractions that maintain precision while ensuring computational efficiency. These abstractions not only power our abstract rendering algorithm but also provide broadly applicable tools for other rendering problems. Our implementation, AbstractSplat, is optimized for scalability, handling up to 750k Gaussians while allowing users to balance memory and runtime through tile and batch-based computation. Compared to the only existing abstract image method for mesh-based scenes, AbstractSplat achieves 2-14x speedups while preserving precision. Our results demonstrate that continuous camera motion, rotations, and scene variations can be rigorously analyzed at scale, making abstract rendering a powerful tool for uncertainty-aware vision applications.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00308](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00308) |

Both of them management is handled on the CPU, while optimization is performed on the GPU, significantly improving system efficiency.

However, accurately representing surfaces, especially in large and complex scenarios, remains a significant challenge due to the unstructured nature of 3DGS. In this paper, we present CityGaussianV2, a novel approach for large-scale scene reconstruction that addresses critical challenges related to geometric accuracy and efficiency. Building on the favorable generalization capabilities of 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), we address its convergence and scalability issues. Specifically, we implement a decomposed-gradient-based densification and depth regression technique to eliminate blurry artifacts and accelerate convergence. To scale up, we introduce an elongation filter that mitigates Gaussian count explosion caused by 2DGS degeneration. Furthermore, we optimize the CityGaussian pipeline for parallel training, achieving up to 10$\\times$ compression, at least 25% savings in training time, and a 50% decrease in memory usage. We also established standard geometry benchmarks under large-scale scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method strikes a promising balance between visual quality, geometric accuracy, as well as storage and training costs.

However, 3D-GS faces critical limitations when generating novel views that significantly deviate from those encountered during training. Moreover, issues such as dilation and aliasing arise during zoom operations. These challenges stem from a fundamental issue: training sampling deficiency. In this paper, we introduce a bootstrapping framework to address this problem. Our approach synthesizes pseudo-ground truth from novel views that align with the limited training set and reintegrates these synthesized views into the training pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that our bootstrapping technique not only reduces artifacts but also improves quantitative metrics. Furthermore, our technique is highly adaptable, allowing various Gaussian-based method to benefit from its integration.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18669](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18669) |

However, achieving photorealistic rendering from extreme novel viewpoints remains challenging, as artifacts persist across representations. In this work, we introduce Difix3D+, a novel pipeline designed to enhance 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis through single-step diffusion models. At the core of our approach is Difix, a single-step image diffusion model trained to enhance and remove artifacts in rendered novel views caused by underconstrained regions of the 3D representation. Difix serves two critical roles in our pipeline. First, it is used during the reconstruction phase to clean up pseudo-training views that are rendered from the reconstruction and then distilled back into 3D. This greatly enhances underconstrained regions and improves the overall 3D representation quality. More importantly, Difix also acts as a neural enhancer during inference, effectively removing residual artifacts arising from imperfect 3D supervision and the limited capacity of current reconstruction models. Difix3D+ is a general solution, a single model compatible with both NeRF and 3DGS representations, and it achieves an average 2$\\times$ improvement in FID score over baselines while maintaining 3D consistency.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01774](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01774) |

However, previous methods are generally constrained by limited-category pre-trained classifiers and implicit semantic representation, which hinder their performance in open-set scenarios and restrict 3D object-level scene understanding. To address these issues, we propose OpenGS-SLAM, an innovative framework that utilizes 3D Gaussian representation to perform dense semantic SLAM in open-set environments. Our system integrates explicit semantic labels derived from 2D foundational models into the 3D Gaussian framework, facilitating robust 3D object-level scene understanding. We introduce Gaussian Voting Splatting to enable fast 2D label map rendering and scene updating. Additionally, we propose a Confidence-based 2D Label Consensus method to ensure consistent labeling across multiple views. Furthermore, we employ a Segmentation Counter Pruning strategy to improve the accuracy of semantic scene representation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in scene understanding, tracking, and mapping, achieving 10 times faster semantic rendering and 2 times lower storage costs compared to existing methods.

| 178 | Poison-splat: Computation Cost Attack on 3D Gaussian Splatting | Jiahao Lu,Yifan Zhang,Qiuhong Shen,Xinchao Wang,Shuicheng Yan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), known for its groundbreaking performance and efficiency, has become a dominant 3D representation and brought progress to many 3D vision tasks. However, in this work, we reveal a significant security vulnerability that has been largely overlooked in 3DGS: the computation cost of training 3DGS could be maliciously tampered by poisoning the input data. By developing an attack named Poison-splat, we reveal a novel attack surface where the adversary can poison the input images to drastically increase the computation memory and time needed for 3DGS training, pushing the algorithm towards its worst computation complexity. In extreme cases, the attack can even consume all allocable memory, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) that disrupts servers, resulting in practical damages to real-world 3DGS service vendors. Such a computation cost attack is achieved by addressing a bi-level optimization problem through three tailored strategies: attack objective approximation, proxy model rendering, and optional constrained optimization. These strategies not only ensure the effectiveness of our attack but also make it difficult to defend with simple defensive measures. We hope the revelation of this novel attack surface can spark attention to this crucial yet overlooked vulnerability of 3DGS systems.

| 177 | LiteGS: A High-Performance Modular Framework for Gaussian Splatting Training | Kaimin Liao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful technique for reconstruction of 3D scenes in computer graphics and vision. However, conventional implementations often suffer from inefficiencies, limited flexibility, and high computational overhead, which constrain their adaptability to diverse applications. In this paper, we present LiteGS,a high-performance and modular framework that enhances both the efficiency and usability of Gaussian splatting. LiteGS achieves a 3.4x speedup over the original 3DGS implementation while reducing GPU memory usage by approximately 30%. Its modular design decomposes the splatting process into multiple highly optimized operators, and it provides dual API support via a script-based interface and a CUDA-based interface. The script-based interface, in combination with autograd, enables rapid prototyping and straightforward customization of new ideas, while the CUDA-based interface delivers optimal training speeds for performance-critical applications. LiteGS retains the core algorithm of 3DGS, ensuring compatibility. Comprehensive experiments on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that LiteGS accelerates training without compromising accuracy, making it an ideal solution for both rapid prototyping and production environments.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01199](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01199) |
| 176 | Dynamic Gaussians Mesh: Consistent Mesh Reconstruction from Dynamic Scenes | Isabella Liu,Hao Su,Xiaolong Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Modern 3D engines and graphics pipelines require mesh as a memory-efficient representation, which allows efficient rendering, geometry processing, texture editing, and many other downstream operations. However, it is still highly difficult to obtain high-quality mesh in terms of detailed structure and time consistency from dynamic observations. To this end, we introduce Dynamic Gaussians Mesh (DG-Mesh), a framework to reconstruct a high-fidelity and time-consistent mesh from dynamic input. Our work leverages the recent advancement in 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct the mesh sequence with temporal consistency from dynamic observations. Building on top of this representation, DG-Mesh recovers high-quality meshes from the Gaussian points and can track the mesh vertices over time, which enables applications such as texture editing on dynamic objects. We introduce the Gaussian-Mesh Anchoring, which encourages evenly distributed Gaussians, resulting better mesh reconstruction through mesh-guided densification and pruning on the deformed Gaussians. By applying cycle-consistent deformation between the canonical and the deformed space, we can project the anchored Gaussian back to the canonical space and optimize Gaussians across all time frames. During the evaluation on different datasets, DG-Mesh provides significantly better mesh reconstruction and rendering than baselines.

Recent advances in neural rendering enable photo-realistic and plausible inverse rendering results. The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has boosted it to the next level by showing real-time rendering potentials. An intuitive finding is that the models used for inverse rendering do not take into account the dependency of opacity w.r.t. material properties, namely cross section, as suggested by optics. Therefore, we develop a novel approach that adds this dependency to the modeling itself. Inspired by radiative transfer, we augment the opacity term by introducing a neural network that takes as input material properties to provide modeling of cross section and a physically correct activation function. The gradients for material properties are therefore not only from color but also from opacity, facilitating a constraint for their optimization. Therefore, the proposed method incorporates more accurate physical properties compared to previous works. We implement our method into 3 different baselines that use Gaussian Splatting for inverse rendering and achieve significant improvements universally in terms of novel view synthesis and material modeling.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10988](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10988) |

However, most prior research has focused on the rendering quality along a pre-recorded vehicle path and struggles to generalize to out-of-path viewpoints, which is caused by the lack of high-quality supervision in those out-of-path views. To address this issue, we introduce an Inverse View Warping technique to create compact and high-quality images as supervision for the reconstruction of the out-of-path views, enabling high-quality rendering results for those views. For accurate and robust inverse view warping, a depth bootstrap strategy is proposed to obtain on-the-fly dense depth maps during the optimization process, overcoming the sparsity and incompleteness of LiDAR depth data. Our method achieves superior in-path and out-of-path reconstruction and rendering performance on the widely used Waymo Open dataset. In addition, a simulator-based benchmark is proposed to obtain the out-of-path ground truth and quantitatively evaluate the performance of out-of-path rendering, where our method outperforms previous methods by a significant margin.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21093](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21093) |

However, the uncertainty in gaussian position and initialization parameters introduces challenges, often requiring extensive iterative convergence and resulting in redundant or insufficient gaussian representations. To address this, we introduce a novel adaptive densification method based on Fourier frequency domain analysis to establish gaussian priors for rapid convergence. Additionally, we propose constructing independent and unified sparse and dense maps, where a sparse map supports efficient tracking via Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP) and a dense map creates high-fidelity visual representations. This is the first SLAM system leveraging frequency domain analysis to achieve high-quality gaussian mapping in real-time.

| 172 | Evolving High-Quality Rendering and Reconstruction in a Unified Framework with Contribution-Adaptive Regularization | You Shen,Zhipeng Zhang,Xinyang Li,Yansong Qu,Yu Lin,Shengchuan Zhang,Liujuan Cao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Representing 3D scenes from multiview images is a core challenge in computer vision and graphics, which requires both precise rendering and accurate reconstruction. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention for its high-quality rendering and fast inference speed. Yet, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds, ensuring accurate geometry reconstruction remains difficult. Existing methods primarily focus on geometry regularization, with common approaches including primitive-based and dual-model frameworks. However, the former suffers from inherent conflicts between rendering and reconstruction, while the latter is computationally and storage-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose CarGS, a unified model leveraging Contribution-adaptive regularization to achieve simultaneous, high-quality rendering and surface reconstruction. The essence of our framework is learning adaptive contribution for Gaussian primitives by squeezing the knowledge from geometry regularization into a compact MLP. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-guided densification strategy with clues from both normals and Signed Distance Fields (SDF) to improve the capability of capturing high-frequency details. Our design improves the mutual learning of the two tasks, meanwhile its unified structure does not require separate models as in dual-model based approaches, guaranteeing efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the ability to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in both rendering fidelity and reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time speed and minimal storage size.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00881](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00881) |

We propose a novel framework leveraging generative 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models to extract 3D dynamic fluid objects from single-view videos. The fluid geometry represented by 3DGS is initially generated from single-frame images, then denoised, densified, and aligned across frames. We estimate the fluid surface velocity using optical flow and compute the mainstream of the fluid to refine it. The 3D volumetric velocity field is then derived from the enclosed surface. The velocity field is then converted into a divergence-free, grid-based representation, enabling the optimization of simulation parameters through its differentiability across frames. This process results in simulation-ready fluid assets with physical dynamics closely matching those observed in the source video. Our approach is applicable to various fluid types, including gas, liquid, and viscous fluids, and allows users to edit the output geometry or extend movement durations seamlessly. Our automatic method for creating 3D dynamic fluid assets from single-view videos, easily obtainable from the internet, shows great potential for generating large-scale 3D fluid assets at a low cost.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00868](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00868) |
| 170 | PSRGS:Progressive Spectral Residual of 3D Gaussian for High-Frequency Recovery | BoCheng Li,WenJuan Zhang,Bing Zhang,YiLing Yao,YaNing Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) achieves impressive results in novel view synthesis for small, single-object scenes through Gaussian ellipsoid initialization and adaptive density control. However, when applied to large-scale remote sensing scenes, 3D GS faces challenges: the point clouds generated by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) are often sparse, and the inherent smoothing behavior of 3D GS leads to over-reconstruction in high-frequency regions, where have detailed textures and color variations. This results in the generation of large, opaque Gaussian ellipsoids that cause gradient artifacts. Moreover, the simultaneous optimization of both geometry and texture may lead to densification of Gaussian ellipsoids at incorrect geometric locations, resulting in artifacts in other views. To address these issues, we propose PSRGS, a progressive optimization scheme based on spectral residual maps. Specifically, we create a spectral residual significance map to separate low-frequency and high-frequency regions. In the low-frequency region, we apply depth-aware and depth-smooth losses to initialize the scene geometry with low threshold. For the high-frequency region, we use gradient features with higher threshold to split and clone ellipsoids, refining the scene. The sampling rate is determined by feature responses and gradient loss. Finally, we introduce a pre-trained network that jointly computes perceptual loss from multiple views, ensuring accurate restoration of high-frequency details in both Gaussian ellipsoids geometry and color. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets to assess the effectiveness of our method, which demonstrates competitive rendering quality, especially in recovering texture details in high-frequency regions.</details> | March 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00848](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00848) |

Although existing methods have achieved photorealistic reconstruction, they mostly focus on pinhole cameras and neglect fisheye cameras. In fact, how to effectively simulate fisheye cameras in driving scene remains an unsolved problem. In this work, we propose UniGaussian, a novel approach that learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation from multiple camera models for urban scene reconstruction in autonomous driving. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a new differentiable rendering method that distorts 3D Gaussians using a series of affine transformations tailored to fisheye camera models. This addresses the compatibility issue of 3D Gaussian splatting with fisheye cameras, which is hindered by light ray distortion caused by lenses or mirrors. Besides, our method maintains real-time rendering while ensuring differentiability. Second, built on the differentiable rendering method, we design a new framework that learns a unified Gaussian representation from multiple camera models. By applying affine transformations to adapt different camera models and regularizing the shared Gaussians with supervision from different modalities, our framework learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation with input data from multiple sources and achieves holistic driving scene understanding. As a result, our approach models multiple sensors (pinhole and fisheye cameras) and modalities (depth, semantic, normal and LiDAR point clouds). Our experiments show that our method achieves superior rendering quality and fast rendering speed for driving scene simulation.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15355](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15355) |
| 163 | 3D StreetUnveiler with Semantic-aware 2DGS -- a simple baseline | Jingwei Xu,Yikai Wang,Yiqun Zhao,Yanwei Fu,Shenghua Gao | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Unveiling an empty street from crowded observations captured by in-car cameras is crucial for autonomous driving. However, removing all temporarily static objects, such as stopped vehicles and standing pedestrians, presents a significant challenge. Unlike object-centric 3D inpainting, which relies on thorough observation in a small scene, street scene cases involve long trajectories that differ from previous 3D inpainting tasks. The camera-centric moving environment of captured videos further complicates the task due to the limited degree and time duration of object observation. To address these obstacles, we introduce StreetUnveiler to reconstruct an empty street. StreetUnveiler learns a 3D representation of the empty street from crowded observations. Our representation is based on the hard-label semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) for its scalability and ability to identify Gaussians to be removed. We inpaint rendered image after removing unwanted Gaussians to provide pseudo-labels and subsequently re-optimize the 2DGS. Given its temporal continuous movement, we divide the empty street scene into observed, partial-observed, and unobserved regions, which we propose to locate through a rendered alpha map. This decomposition helps us to minimize the regions that need to be inpainted. To enhance the temporal consistency of the inpainting, we introduce a novel time-reversal framework to inpaint frames in reverse order and use later frames as references for earlier frames to fully utilize the long-trajectory observations. Our experiments conducted on the street scene dataset successfully reconstructed a 3D representation of the empty street. The mesh representation of the empty street can be extracted for further applications.

We propose a novel hybrid representation, termed as HybridGS, using 2D Gaussians for transient objects per image and maintaining traditional 3D Gaussians for the whole static scenes. Note that, the 3DGS itself is better suited for modeling static scenes that assume multi-view consistency, but the transient objects appear occasionally and do not adhere to the assumption, thus we model them as planar objects from a single view, represented with 2D Gaussians. Our novel representation decomposes the scene from the perspective of fundamental viewpoint consistency, making it more reasonable. Additionally, we present a novel multi-view regulated supervision method for 3DGS that leverages information from co-visible regions, further enhancing the distinctions between the transients and statics. Then, we propose a straightforward yet effective multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust training and high-quality view synthesis across various settings. Experiments on benchmark datasets show our state-of-the-art performance of novel view synthesis in both indoor and outdoor scenes, even in the presence of distracting elements.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03844](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03844) |

As a result, the need for labeled surgical datasets continues to grow. In this work, we introduce a differentiable rendering framework for material and lighting estimation from endoscopic images and known geometry. Compared to previous approaches that model lighting and material jointly as radiance, we explicitly disentangle these scene properties for robust and photorealistic novel view synthesis. To disambiguate the training process, we formulate domain-specific properties inherent in surgical scenes. Specifically, we model the scene lighting as a simple spotlight and material properties as a bidirectional reflectance distribution function, parameterized by a neural network. By grounding color predictions in the rendering equation, we can generate photorealistic images at arbitrary camera poses. We evaluate our method with various sequences from the Colonoscopy 3D Video Dataset and show that our method produces competitive novel view synthesis results compared with other approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that synthetic data can be used to develop 3D vision algorithms by finetuning a depth estimation model with our rendered outputs. Overall, we see that the depth estimation performance is on par with fine-tuning with the original real images.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20669](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20669) |
| 160 | 3D-HGS: 3D Half-Gaussian Splatting | Haolin Li,Jinyang Liu,Mario Sznaier,Octavia Camps | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Photo-realistic image rendering from scene 3D reconstruction is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision. This domain has seen considerable advancements owing to the advent of recent neural rendering techniques. These techniques predominantly aim to focus on learning volumetric representations of 3D scenes and refining these representations via loss functions derived from their rendering. Among these, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a preferred method, surpassing Neural Radiance Fields' (NeRFs) quality and rendering speed. 3D-GS uses parameterized 3D Gaussians to model both spatial locations and color information, combined with a tile-based fast rendering technique. Despite its superior performance, using 3D Gaussian kernels has inherent limitations in accurately representing discontinuous functions, notably at edges and corners corresponding to shape discontinuities, and across varying textures due to color discontinuities. In this paper, we introduce 3D Half-Gaussian (\\textbf{3D-HGS}) kernels, which can be used as a plug-and-play kernel, to address this issue. Our experiments demonstrate their capability to improve the performance of current 3D-GS related methods and achieve state-of-the-art rendering quality performance on various datasets without compromising their rendering speed.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02720](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02720) |

Since tasks may require clarification or re-specification, it is necessary for the information in the map to be rich enough to enable generalization across a wide range of tasks. To effectively execute tasks specified in natural language, we propose a hierarchical representation built on language-embedded Gaussian splatting that enables both sparse semantic planning that lends itself to online operation and dense geometric representation for collision-free navigation. We validate the effectiveness of our method through real-world robot experiments conducted in both cluttered indoor and kilometer-scale outdoor environments, with a competitive ratio of about 60% against privileged baselines.

| 158 | Efficient Gaussian Splatting for Monocular Dynamic Scene Rendering via Sparse Time-Variant Attribute Modeling | Hanyang Kong,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Rendering dynamic scenes from monocular videos is a crucial yet challenging task. The recent deformable Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a robust solution to represent real-world dynamic scenes. However, it often leads to heavily redundant Gaussians, attempting to fit every training view at various time steps, leading to slower rendering speeds. Additionally, the attributes of Gaussians in static areas are time-invariant, making it unnecessary to model every Gaussian, which can cause jittering in static regions. In practice, the primary bottleneck in rendering speed for dynamic scenes is the number of Gaussians. In response, we introduce Efficient Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (EDGS), which represents dynamic scenes via sparse time-variant attribute modeling. Our approach formulates dynamic scenes using a sparse anchor-grid representation, with the motion flow of dense Gaussians calculated via a classical kernel representation. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised strategy to efficiently filter out anchors corresponding to static areas. Only anchors associated with deformable objects are input into MLPs to query time-variant attributes. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our EDGS significantly improves the rendering speed with superior rendering quality compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20378](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20378) |

However, adopting point clouds as 3D representation fails to fully capture the intricacies of the 3D world and exhibits a noticeable gap between the discrete points and the dense 2D pixels of images. To tackle this issue, we propose UniGS, integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into multi-modal pre-training to enhance the 3D representation. We first rely on the 3DGS representation to model the 3D world as a collection of 3D Gaussians with color and opacity, incorporating all the information of the 3D scene while establishing a strong connection with 2D images. Then, to achieve Language-Image-3D pertaining, UniGS starts with a pre-trained vision-language model to establish a shared visual and textual space through extensive real-world image-text pairs. Subsequently, UniGS employs a 3D encoder to align the optimized 3DGS with the Language-Image representations to learn unified multi-modal representations. To facilitate the extraction of global explicit 3D features by the 3D encoder and achieve better cross-modal alignment, we additionally introduce a novel Gaussian-Aware Guidance module that guides the learning of fine-grained representations of the 3D domain. Through extensive experiments across the Objaverse, ABO, MVImgNet and SUN RGBD datasets with zero-shot classification, text-driven retrieval and open-world understanding tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of UniGS in learning a more general and stronger aligned multi-modal representation. Specifically, UniGS achieves leading results across different 3D tasks with remarkable improvements over previous SOTA, Uni3D, including on zero-shot classification (+9.36%), text-driven retrieval (+4.3%) and open-world understanding (+7.92%).</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17860](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17860) |
| 156 | Open-Vocabulary Semantic Part Segmentation of 3D Human | Keito Suzuki,Bang Du,Girish Krishnan,Kunyao Chen,Runfa Blark Li,Truong Nguyen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D part segmentation is still an open problem in the field of 3D vision and AR/VR. Due to limited 3D labeled data, traditional supervised segmentation methods fall short in generalizing to unseen shapes and categories. Recently, the advancement in vision-language models' zero-shot abilities has brought a surge in open-world 3D segmentation methods. While these methods show promising results for 3D scenes or objects, they do not generalize well to 3D humans. In this paper, we present the first open-vocabulary segmentation method capable of handling 3D human. Our framework can segment the human category into desired fine-grained parts based on the textual prompt. We design a simple segmentation pipeline, leveraging SAM to generate multi-view proposals in 2D and proposing a novel HumanCLIP model to create unified embeddings for visual and textual inputs. Compared with existing pre-trained CLIP models, the HumanCLIP model yields more accurate embeddings for human-centric contents. We also design a simple-yet-effective MaskFusion module, which classifies and fuses multi-view features into 3D semantic masks without complex voting and grouping mechanisms. The design of decoupling mask proposals and text input also significantly boosts the efficiency of per-prompt inference. Experimental results on various 3D human datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation methods by a large margin. In addition, we show that our method can be directly applied to various 3D representations including meshes, point clouds, and 3D Gaussian Splatting.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19782](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19782) |
| 155 | Generative Gaussian Splatting for Unbounded 3D City Generation | Haozhe Xie,Zhaoxi Chen,Fangzhou Hong,Ziwei Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D city generation with NeRF-based methods shows promising generation results but is computationally inefficient. Recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a highly efficient alternative for object-level 3D generation. However, adapting 3D-GS from finite-scale 3D objects and humans to infinite-scale 3D cities is non-trivial. Unbounded 3D city generation entails significant storage overhead (out-of-memory issues), arising from the need to expand points to billions, often demanding hundreds of Gigabytes of VRAM for a city scene spanning 10km^2. In this paper, we propose GaussianCity, a generative Gaussian Splatting framework dedicated to efficiently synthesizing unbounded 3D cities with a single feed-forward pass. Our key insights are two-fold: 1) Compact 3D Scene Representation: We introduce BEV-Point as a highly compact intermediate representation, ensuring that the growth in VRAM usage for unbounded scenes remains constant, thus enabling unbounded city generation. 2) Spatial-aware Gaussian Attribute Decoder: We present spatial-aware BEV-Point decoder to produce 3D Gaussian attributes, which leverages Point Serializer to integrate the structural and contextual characteristics of BEV points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaussianCity achieves state-of-the-art results in both drone-view and street-view 3D city generation. Notably, compared to CityDreamer, GaussianCity exhibits superior performance with a speedup of 60 times (10.72 FPS v.s. 0.18 FPS).</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06526](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06526) |
| 154 | GStex: Per-Primitive Texturing of 2D Gaussian Splatting for Decoupled Appearance and Geometry Modeling | Victor Rong,Jingxiang Chen,Sherwin Bahmani,Kiriakos N. Kutulakos,David B. Lindell | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian splatting has demonstrated excellent performance for view synthesis and scene reconstruction. The representation achieves photorealistic quality by optimizing the position, scale, color, and opacity of thousands to millions of 2D or 3D Gaussian primitives within a scene. However, since each Gaussian primitive encodes both appearance and geometry, these attributes are strongly coupled--thus, high-fidelity appearance modeling requires a large number of Gaussian primitives, even when the scene geometry is simple (e.g., for a textured planar surface). We propose to texture each 2D Gaussian primitive so that even a single Gaussian can be used to capture appearance details. By employing per-primitive texturing, our appearance representation is agnostic to the topology and complexity of the scene's geometry. We show that our approach, GStex, yields improved visual quality over prior work in texturing Gaussian splats. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our decoupling enables improved novel view synthesis performance compared to 2D Gaussian splatting when reducing the number of Gaussian primitives, and that GStex can be used for scene appearance editing and re-texturing.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12954](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12954) |
| 153 | Does 3D Gaussian Splatting Need Accurate Volumetric Rendering? | Adam Celarek,George Kopanas,George Drettakis,Michael Wimmer,Bernhard Kerbl | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become an important reference method for learning 3D representations of a captured scene, allowing real-time novel-view synthesis with high visual quality and fast training times. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which preceded 3DGS, are based on a principled ray-marching approach for volumetric rendering. In contrast, while sharing a similar image formation model with NeRF, 3DGS uses a hybrid rendering solution that builds on the strengths of volume rendering and primitive rasterization. A crucial benefit of 3DGS is its performance, achieved through a set of approximations, in many cases with respect to volumetric rendering theory. A naturally arising question is whether replacing these approximations with more principled volumetric rendering solutions can improve the quality of 3DGS. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of the various approximations and assumptions used by the original 3DGS solution. We demonstrate that, while more accurate volumetric rendering can help for low numbers of primitives, the power of efficient optimization and the large number of Gaussians allows 3DGS to outperform volumetric rendering despite its approximations.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19318](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19318) |

Unlike traditional neural radiance field (NeRF) methods, which typically rely on implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values, 3DGS utilizes millions of learnable 3D Gaussians. Its differentiable rendering technique and inherent capability for explicit scene representation and manipulation positions 3DGS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation technologies. This enables 3DGS to deliver real-time rendering speeds while offering unparalleled editability levels. However, despite its advantages, 3DGS suffers from substantial memory and storage requirements, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview focusing on the scalability and compression of 3DGS. We begin with a detailed background overview of 3DGS, followed by a structured taxonomy of existing compression methods. Additionally, we analyze and compare current methods from the topological perspective, evaluating their strengths and limitations in terms of fidelity, compression ratios, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we explore how advancements in efficient NeRF representations can inspire future developments in 3DGS optimization. Finally, we conclude with current research challenges and highlight key directions for future exploration.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19457](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19457) |
| 151 | Scaffold-SLAM: Structured 3D Gaussians for Simultaneous Localization and Photorealistic Mapping | Tianci Wen,Zhiang Liu,Biao Lu,Yongchun Fang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently revolutionized novel view synthesis in the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). However, existing SLAM methods utilizing 3DGS have failed to provide high-quality novel view rendering for monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras simultaneously. Notably, some methods perform well for RGB-D cameras but suffer significant degradation in rendering quality for monocular cameras. In this paper, we present Scaffold-SLAM, which delivers simultaneous localization and high-quality photorealistic mapping across monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras. We introduce two key innovations to achieve this state-of-the-art visual quality. First, we propose Appearance-from-Motion embedding, enabling 3D Gaussians to better model image appearance variations across different camera poses. Second, we introduce a frequency regularization pyramid to guide the distribution of Gaussians, allowing the model to effectively capture finer details in the scene. Extensive experiments on monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets demonstrate that Scaffold-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in photorealistic mapping quality, e.g., PSNR is 16.76% higher in the TUM RGB-D datasets for monocular cameras.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05242](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05242) |
| 150 | GaussianFlowOcc: Sparse and Weakly Supervised Occupancy Estimation using Gaussian Splatting and Temporal Flow | Simon Boeder,Fabian Gigengack,Benjamin Risse | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Occupancy estimation has become a prominent task in 3D computer vision, particularly within the autonomous driving community. In this paper, we present a novel approach to occupancy estimation, termed GaussianFlowOcc, which is inspired by Gaussian Splatting and replaces traditional dense voxel grids with a sparse 3D Gaussian representation. Our efficient model architecture based on a Gaussian Transformer significantly reduces computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need for expensive 3D convolutions used with inefficient voxel-based representations that predominantly represent empty 3D spaces. GaussianFlowOcc effectively captures scene dynamics by estimating temporal flow for each Gaussian during the overall network training process, offering a straightforward solution to a complex problem that is often neglected by existing methods. Moreover, GaussianFlowOcc is designed for scalability, as it employs weak supervision and does not require costly dense 3D voxel annotations based on additional data (e.g., LiDAR). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that GaussianFlowOcc significantly outperforms all previous methods for weakly supervised occupancy estimation on the nuScenes dataset while featuring an inference speed that is 50 times faster than current SOTA.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17288](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17288) |

It is observed existing methods have various limitations, such as requiring precise camera poses for input and dense viewpoints for supervision. To perform effective and efficient 3D scene reconstruction, we propose a novel graph-guided 3D scene reconstruction framework, GraphGS. Specifically, given a set of images captured by RGB cameras on a scene, we first design a spatial prior-based scene structure estimation method. This is then used to create a camera graph that includes information about the camera topology. Further, we propose to apply the graph-guided multi-view consistency constraint and adaptive sampling strategy to the 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization process. This greatly alleviates the issue of Gaussian points overfitting to specific sparse viewpoints and expedites the 3D reconstruction process.

| 148 | Laplace-Beltrami Operator for Gaussian Splatting | Hongyu Zhou,Zorah L\xc3\xa4hner | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the rising popularity of 3D Gaussian splatting and the expanse of applications from rendering to 3D reconstruction, there comes also a need for geometry processing applications directly on this new representation. While considering the centers of Gaussians as a point cloud or meshing them is an option that allows to apply existing algorithms, this might ignore information present in the data or be unnecessarily expensive. Additionally, Gaussian splatting tends to contain a large number of outliers which do not affect the rendering quality but need to be handled correctly in order not to produce noisy results in geometry processing applications. In this work, we propose a formulation to compute the Laplace-Beltrami operator, a widely used tool in geometry processing, directly on Gaussian splatting using the Mahalanobis distance. While conceptually similar to a point cloud Laplacian, our experiments show superior accuracy on the point clouds encoded in the Gaussian splatting centers and, additionally, the operator can be used to evaluate the quality of the output during optimization.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17531](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17531) |

Recent works typically struggle to effectively understand and adapt to dynamic environments due to the inability to update their environment representations in memory according to environment changes and lack of fine-grained reconstruction of the environments. To address these challenges, we propose DynamicGSG, a dynamic, high-fidelity, open-vocabulary scene graph construction system leveraging Gaussian splatting. DynamicGSG builds hierarchical scene graphs using advanced vision language models to represent the spatial and semantic relationships between objects in the environments, utilizes a joint feature loss we designed to supervise Gaussian instance grouping while optimizing the Gaussian maps, and locally updates the Gaussian scene graphs according to real environment changes for long-term environment adaptation. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the performance and efficacy of our proposed method in terms of semantic segmentation, language-guided object retrieval, and reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we validate the dynamic updating capabilities of our system in real laboratory environments.

However, existing methods face challenges such as a lack of multi-view geometric consistency and limited controllability during the generation process, which significantly restrict their usability. % To tackle these challenges, we introduce Dragen3D, a novel approach that achieves geometrically consistent and controllable 3D generation leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We introduce the Anchor-Gaussian Variational Autoencoder (Anchor-GS VAE), which encodes a point cloud and a single image into anchor latents and decode these latents into 3DGS, enabling efficient latent-space generation. To enable multi-view geometry consistent and controllable generation, we propose a Seed-Point-Driven strategy: first generate sparse seed points as a coarse geometry representation, then map them to anchor latents via the Seed-Anchor Mapping Module. Geometric consistency is ensured by the easily learned sparse seed points, and users can intuitively drag the seed points to deform the final 3DGS geometry, with changes propagated through the anchor latents. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve geometrically controllable 3D Gaussian generation and editing without relying on 2D diffusion priors, delivering comparable 3D generation quality to state-of-the-art methods.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16475](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16475) |

However, recent Sim2real methods either rely on a large amount of augmented data or large learning models, which is inefficient for specific tasks. In recent years, with the emergence of radiance field reconstruction methods, especially 3D Gaussian splatting, it has become possible to construct realistic real-world scenes. To this end, we propose RL-GSBridge, a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework which incorporates 3D Gaussian Splatting into the conventional RL simulation pipeline, enabling zero-shot sim-to-real transfer for vision-based deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a mesh-based 3D GS method with soft binding constraints, enhancing the rendering quality of mesh models.

| 139 | RGB-Only Gaussian Splatting SLAM for Unbounded Outdoor Scenes | Sicheng Yu,Chong Cheng,Yifan Zhou,Xiaojun Yang,Hao Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM, as it can produce high-fidelity novel views. However, previous GS-based methods primarily target indoor scenes and rely on RGB-D sensors or pre-trained depth estimation models, hence underperforming in outdoor scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a RGB-only gaussian splatting SLAM method for unbounded outdoor scenes--OpenGS-SLAM. Technically, we first employ a pointmap regression network to generate consistent pointmaps between frames for pose estimation. Compared to commonly used depth maps, pointmaps include spatial relationships and scene geometry across multiple views, enabling robust camera pose estimation. Then, we propose integrating the estimated camera poses with 3DGS rendering as an end-to-end differentiable pipeline. Our method achieves simultaneous optimization of camera poses and 3DGS scene parameters, significantly enhancing system tracking accuracy. Specifically, we also design an adaptive scale mapper for the pointmap regression network, which provides more accurate pointmap mapping to the 3DGS map representation. Our experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that OpenGS-SLAM reduces tracking error to 9.8\\% of previous 3DGS methods, and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis.

A desired virtual 3D scene should 1) exhibit omnidirectional view consistency, and 2) allow for free exploration in complex scene hierarchies. Existing methods either rely on successive scene expansion via inpainting or employ panorama representation to represent large FOV scene environments. However, the generated scene suffers from semantic drift during expansion and is unable to handle occlusion among scene hierarchies. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Layerpano3D, a novel framework for full-view, explorable panoramic 3D scene generation from a single text prompt. Our key insight is to decompose a reference 2D panorama into multiple layers at different depth levels, where each layer reveals the unseen space from the reference views via diffusion prior. Layerpano3D comprises multiple dedicated designs: 1) We introduce a new panorama dataset Upright360, comprising 9k high-quality and upright panorama images, and finetune the advanced Flux model on Upright360 for high-quality, upright and consistent panorama generation. 2) We pioneer the Layered 3D Panorama as underlying representation to manage complex scene hierarchies and lift it into 3D Gaussians to splat detailed 360-degree omnidirectional scenes with unconstrained viewing paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates state-of-the-art 3D panoramic scene in both full view consistency and immersive exploratory experience. We believe that Layerpano3D holds promise for advancing 3D panoramic scene creation with numerous applications.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13252](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13252) |
| 137 | SplatOverflow: Asynchronous Hardware Troubleshooting | Amritansh Kwatra,Tobias Weinberg,Ilan Mandel,Ritik Batra,Peter He,Francois Guimbretiere,Thijs Roumen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>As tools for designing and manufacturing hardware become more accessible, smaller producers can develop and distribute novel hardware. However, processes for supporting end-user hardware troubleshooting or routine maintenance aren't well defined. As a result, providing technical support for hardware remains ad-hoc and challenging to scale. Inspired by patterns that helped scale software troubleshooting, we propose a workflow for asynchronous hardware troubleshooting: SplatOverflow.  SplatOverflow creates a novel boundary object, the SplatOverflow scene, that users reference to communicate about hardware. A scene comprises a 3D Gaussian Splat of the user's hardware registered onto the hardware's CAD model. The splat captures the current state of the hardware, and the registered CAD model acts as a referential anchor for troubleshooting instructions. With SplatOverflow, remote maintainers can directly address issues and author instructions in the user's workspace. Workflows containing multiple instructions can easily be shared between users and recontextualized in new environments.  In this paper, we describe the design of SplatOverflow, the workflows it enables, and its utility to different kinds of users. We also validate that non-experts can use SplatOverflow to troubleshoot common problems with a 3D printer in a usability study.

| 136 | CDGS: Confidence-Aware Depth Regularization for 3D Gaussian Splatting | Qilin Zhang,Olaf Wysocki,Steffen Urban,Boris Jutzi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown significant advantages in novel view synthesis (NVS), particularly in achieving high rendering speeds and high-quality results. However, its geometric accuracy in 3D reconstruction remains limited due to the lack of explicit geometric constraints during optimization. This paper introduces CDGS, a confidence-aware depth regularization approach developed to enhance 3DGS. We leverage multi-cue confidence maps of monocular depth estimation and sparse Structure-from-Motion depth to adaptively adjust depth supervision during the optimization process. Our method demonstrates improved geometric detail preservation in early training stages and achieves competitive performance in both NVS quality and geometric accuracy. Experiments on the publicly available Tanks and Temples benchmark dataset show that our method achieves more stable convergence behavior and more accurate geometric reconstruction results, with improvements of up to 2.31 dB in PSNR for NVS and consistently lower geometric errors in M3C2 distance metrics. Notably, our method reaches comparable F-scores to the original 3DGS with only 50% of the training iterations. We expect this work will facilitate the development of efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction systems for real-world applications such as digital twin creation, heritage preservation, or forestry applications.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14684](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14684) |

Stuckey,Ian Reid,Hamid Rezatofighi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose Hier-SLAM++, a comprehensive Neuro-Symbolic semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method with both RGB-D and monocular input featuring an advanced hierarchical categorical representation, which enables accurate pose estimation as well as global 3D semantic mapping. The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making scene understanding particularly challenging and costly. To address this problem, we introduce a novel and general hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantic monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM system, significantly reducing sensor requirements for 3D semantic understanding and broadening the applicability of semantic Gaussian SLAM system. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior or on-par performance with state-of-the-art NeRF-based and Gaussian-based SLAM systems, while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14931](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14931) |

With advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), previous studies have applied it to reconstruct complex dynamic driving scenes. These methods typically require expensive LiDAR sensors and pre-annotated datasets of dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we propose OG-Gaussian, a novel approach that replaces LiDAR point clouds with Occupancy Grids (OGs) generated from surround-view camera images using Occupancy Prediction Network (ONet). Our method leverages the semantic information in OGs to separate dynamic vehicles from static street background, converting these grids into two distinct sets of initial point clouds for reconstructing both static and dynamic objects. Additionally, we estimate the trajectories and poses of dynamic objects through a learning-based approach, eliminating the need for complex manual annotations. Experiments on Waymo Open dataset demonstrate that OG-Gaussian is on par with the current state-of-the-art in terms of reconstruction quality and rendering speed, achieving an average PSNR of 35.13 and a rendering speed of 143 FPS, while significantly reducing computational costs and economic overhead.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14235](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14235) |

Lin,Jiayuan Gu,Hao Su,Gordon Wetzstein,Leonidas Guibas | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Multi-view image diffusion models have significantly advanced open-domain 3D object generation. However, most existing models rely on 2D network architectures that lack inherent 3D biases, resulting in compromised geometric consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-in module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusion models. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: for each denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediate multi-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes the rendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through feature addition. We study two variants of 3D-Adapter: a fast feed-forward version based on Gaussian splatting and a versatile training-free version utilizing neural fields and meshes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-Adapter not only greatly enhances the geometry quality of text-to-multi-view models such as Instant3D and Zero123++, but also enables high-quality 3D generation using the plain text-to-image Stable Diffusion. Furthermore, we showcase the broad application potential of 3D-Adapter by presenting high quality results in text-to-3D, image-to-3D, text-to-texture, and text-to-avatar tasks.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18974](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18974) |

Most methods assume the people is in an unobstructed scene, while various objects may cause the occlusion of body parts in real-life scenarios. Previous method utilizing NeRF for surface rendering to recover the occluded areas, but it requiring more than one day to train and several seconds to render, failing to meet the requirements of real-time interactive applications. To address these issues, we propose OccGaussian based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which can be trained within 6 minutes and produces high-quality human renderings up to 160 FPS with occluded input. OccGaussian initializes 3D Gaussian distributions in the canonical space, and we perform occlusion feature query at occluded regions, the aggregated pixel-align feature is extracted to compensate for the missing information. Then we use Gaussian Feature MLP to further process the feature along with the occlusion-aware loss functions to better perceive the occluded area. Extensive experiments both in simulated and real-world occlusions, demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method. And we improving training and inference speeds by 250x and 800x, respectively.

| 130 | GlossGau: Efficient Inverse Rendering for Glossy Surface with Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian | Bang Du,Runfa Blark Li,Chen Du,Truong Nguyen | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The reconstruction of 3D objects from calibrated photographs represents a fundamental yet intricate challenge in the domains of computer graphics and vision. Although neural reconstruction approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable capabilities, their processing costs remain substantial. Recently, the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) largely improves the training efficiency and facilitates to generate realistic rendering in real-time. However, due to the limited ability of Spherical Harmonics (SH) to represent high-frequency information, 3D-GS falls short in reconstructing glossy objects. Researchers have turned to enhance the specular expressiveness of 3D-GS through inverse rendering. Yet these methods often struggle to maintain the training and rendering efficiency, undermining the benefits of Gaussian Splatting techniques. In this paper, we introduce GlossGau, an efficient inverse rendering framework that reconstructs scenes with glossy surfaces while maintaining training and rendering speeds comparable to vanilla 3D-GS. Specifically, we explicitly model the surface normals, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) parameters, as well as incident lights and use Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) to approximate the per-Gaussian Normal Distribution Function under the microfacet model. We utilize 2D Gaussian Splatting (2D-GS) as foundational primitives and apply regularization to significantly alleviate the normal estimation challenge encountered in related works. Experiments demonstrate that GlossGau achieves competitive or superior reconstruction on datasets with glossy surfaces. Compared with previous GS-based works that address the specular surface, our optimization time is considerably less.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14129](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14129) |

Richard Yu,Gang Xu,Fei Ma,Ming Li,Guang Zhou | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in implicit 3D reconstruction methods, e.g., neural rendering fields and Gaussian splatting, have primarily focused on novel view synthesis of static or dynamic objects with continuous motion states. However, these approaches struggle to efficiently model a human-interactive object with n movable parts, requiring 2^n separate models to represent all discrete states. To overcome this limitation, we propose Inter3D, a new benchmark and approach for novel state synthesis of human-interactive objects. We introduce a self-collected dataset featuring commonly encountered interactive objects and a new evaluation pipeline, where only individual part states are observed during training, while part combination states remain unseen. We also propose a strong baseline approach that leverages Space Discrepancy Tensors to efficiently modelling all states of an object. To alleviate the impractical constraints on camera trajectories across training states, we propose a Mutual State Regularization mechanism to enhance the spatial density consistency of movable parts. In addition, we explore two occupancy grid sampling strategies to facilitate training efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark, showcasing the challenges of the task and the superiority of our approach.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14004](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14004) |

First, we propose a hybrid explicit representation that combines the advantages of two primitive-based efficient rendering techniques. UV-mapped 3D mesh is utilized to capture sharp and rich textures on smooth surfaces, while 3D Gaussian Splatting is employed to represent complex geometric structures. In the pipeline of modeling an avatar, after tracking parametric models based on captured multi-view RGB videos, our goal is to simultaneously optimize the texture and opacity map of mesh, as well as a set of 3D Gaussian splats localized and rigged onto the mesh facets. Specifically, we perform $\xce\xb1$-blending on the color and opacity values based on the merged and re-ordered z-buffer from the rasterization results of mesh and 3DGS. This process involves the mesh and 3DGS adaptively fitting the captured visual information to outline a high-fidelity digital avatar. To avoid artifacts caused by Gaussian splats crossing the mesh facets, we design a stable hybrid depth sorting strategy. Experiments illustrate that our modeled results exceed those of state-of-the-art approaches.</details> | March 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11453](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11453) |

However, in real-world environments with dynamic objects, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems often face mapping errors and tracking drift issues. To address these problems, we propose GARAD-SLAM, a real-time 3DGS-based SLAM system tailored for dynamic scenes. In terms of tracking, unlike traditional methods, we directly perform dynamic segmentation on Gaussians and map them back to the front-end to obtain dynamic point labels through a Gaussian pyramid network, achieving precise dynamic removal and robust tracking. For mapping, we impose rendering penalties on dynamically labeled Gaussians, which are updated through the network, to avoid irreversible erroneous removal caused by simple pruning. Our results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive in tracking compared to baseline methods, generating fewer artifacts and higher-quality reconstructions in rendering.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03228](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03228) |

However, existing approaches based on high-capacity neural networks typically require a desktop GPU to achieve real-time performance for a single avatar, and it remains non-trivial to animate and render such avatars on mobile devices including a standalone VR headset due to substantially limited memory and computational bandwidth. In this paper, we present SqueezeMe, a simple and highly effective framework to convert high-fidelity 3D Gaussian full-body avatars into a lightweight representation that supports both animation and rendering with mobile-grade compute. Our key observation is that the decoding of pose-dependent Gaussian attributes from a neural network creates non-negligible memory and computational overhead. Inspired by blendshapes and linear pose correctives widely used in Computer Graphics, we address this by distilling the pose correctives learned with neural networks into linear layers. Moreover, we further reduce the parameters by sharing the correctives among nearby Gaussians.

Current prediction methods are limited by training and storage efficiency, mainly focusing on 2D spatial predictions at specific altitudes. Meanwhile, 3D volumetric predictions at each timestamp remain largely unexplored. To address such a challenge, we introduce a comprehensive framework for 3D radar sequence prediction in weather nowcasting, using the newly proposed SpatioTemporal Coherent Gaussian Splatting (STC-GS) for dynamic radar representation and GauMamba for efficient and accurate forecasting. Specifically, rather than relying on a 4D Gaussian for dynamic scene reconstruction, STC-GS optimizes 3D scenes at each frame by employing a group of Gaussians while effectively capturing their movements across consecutive frames. It ensures consistent tracking of each Gaussian over time, making it particularly effective for prediction tasks. With the temporally correlated Gaussian groups established, we utilize them to train GauMamba, which integrates a memory mechanism into the Mamba framework. This allows the model to learn the temporal evolution of Gaussian groups while efficiently handling a large volume of Gaussian tokens. As a result, it achieves both efficiency and accuracy in forecasting a wide range of dynamic meteorological radar signals. The experimental results demonstrate that our STC-GS can efficiently represent 3D radar sequences with over $16\\times$ higher spatial resolution compared with the existing 3D representation methods, while GauMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting a broad spectrum of high-dynamic weather conditions.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14895](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14895) |

Although existing methods achieve reasonable text-to-3D generation of human bodies using various 3D representations, they often face limitations in fidelity and efficiency, or primarily focus on static models with limited pose control. In contrast, our method generates fully animatable 3D avatars by combining deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting with text-to-3D score distillation, achieving high fidelity and efficient rendering for arbitrary poses. By densely generating diverse random poses during optimization, our deformable 3D human model learns to capture a wide range of natural motions distilled from a pose-conditioned diffusion model in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Score Distillation that effectively balances realistic detail and smoothness to achieve optimal 3D results.

| 118 | View-Consistent 3D Editing with Gaussian Splatting | Yuxuan Wang,Xuanyu Yi,Zike Wu,Na Zhao,Long Chen,Hanwang Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D editing, offering efficient, high-fidelity rendering and enabling precise local manipulations. Currently, diffusion-based 2D editing models are harnessed to modify multi-view rendered images, which then guide the editing of 3DGS models. However, this approach faces a critical issue of multi-view inconsistency, where the guidance images exhibit significant discrepancies across views, leading to mode collapse and visual artifacts of 3DGS. To this end, we introduce View-consistent Editing (VcEdit), a novel framework that seamlessly incorporates 3DGS into image editing processes, ensuring multi-view consistency in edited guidance images and effectively mitigating mode collapse issues. VcEdit employs two innovative consistency modules: the Cross-attention Consistency Module and the Editing Consistency Module, both designed to reduce inconsistencies in edited images. By incorporating these consistency modules into an iterative pattern, VcEdit proficiently resolves the issue of multi-view inconsistency, facilitating high-quality 3DGS editing across a diverse range of scenes.

| 117 | GS-GVINS: A Tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System Augmented by 3D Gaussian Splatting | Zelin Zhou,Saurav Uprety,Shichuang Nie,Hongzhou Yang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has drawn significant attention in the area of 3D map reconstruction and visual SLAM. While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10975](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10975) |

In contrast, event cameras are significantly more resilient to these limitations but have been less explored in this domain, particularly in large-scale settings. Current methodologies primarily focus on front-facing or object-oriented (360-degree view) scenarios. For the first time, we introduce 3D Gaussians for event-based novel view synthesis. Our method reconstructs large and unbounded scenes with high visual quality. We contribute the first real and synthetic event datasets tailored for this setting. Our method demonstrates superior novel view synthesis and consistently outperforms the baseline EventNeRF by a margin of 11-25% in PSNR (dB) while being orders of magnitude faster in reconstruction and rendering.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10827](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10827) |
| 115 | GaussianSpa: An "Optimizing-Sparsifying" Simplification Framework for Compact and High-Quality 3D Gaussian Splatting | Yangming Zhang,Wenqi Jia,Wei Niu,Miao Yin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a mainstream for novel view synthesis, leveraging continuous aggregations of Gaussian functions to model scene geometry. However, 3DGS suffers from substantial memory requirements to store the multitude of Gaussians, hindering its practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce GaussianSpa, an optimization-based simplification framework for compact and high-quality 3DGS. Specifically, we formulate the simplification as an optimization problem associated with the 3DGS training. Correspondingly, we propose an efficient "optimizing-sparsifying" solution that alternately solves two independent sub-problems, gradually imposing strong sparsity onto the Gaussians in the training process. Our comprehensive evaluations on various datasets show the superiority of GaussianSpa over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, GaussianSpa achieves an average PSNR improvement of 0.9 dB on the real-world Deep Blending dataset with 10$\\times$ fewer Gaussians compared to the vanilla 3DGS.

| 114 | X-SG$^2$S: Safe and Generalizable Gaussian Splatting with X-dimensional Watermarks | Zihang Cheng,Huiping Zhuang,Chun Li,Xin Meng,Ming Li,Fei Richard Yu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has been widely used in 3D reconstruction and 3D generation. Training to get a 3DGS scene often takes a lot of time and resources and even valuable inspiration. The increasing amount of 3DGS digital asset have brought great challenges to the copyright protection. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. In this paper, we propose a new framework X-SG$^2$S which can simultaneously watermark 1 to 3D messages while keeping the original 3DGS scene almost unchanged. Generally, we have a X-SG$^2$S injector for adding multi-modal messages simultaneously and an extractor for extract them. Specifically, we first split the watermarks into message patches in a fixed manner and sort the 3DGS points. A self-adaption gate is used to pick out suitable location for watermarking. Then use a XD(multi-dimension)-injection heads to add multi-modal messages into sorted 3DGS points. A learnable gate can recognize the location with extra messages and XD-extraction heads can restore hidden messages from the location recommended by the learnable gate. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed X-SG$^2$S can effectively conceal multi modal messages without changing pretrained 3DGS pipeline or the original form of 3DGS parameters. Meanwhile, with simple and efficient model structure and high practicality, X-SG$^2$S still shows good performance in hiding and extracting multi-modal inner structured or unstructured messages. X-SG$^2$S is the first to unify 1 to 3D watermarking model for 3DGS and the first framework to add multi-modal watermarks simultaneous in one 3DGS which pave the wave for later researches.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10475](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10475) |

Recently, several techniques have been proposed for connecting these low-level representations with the high-level semantics understanding embodied within the scene. These methods elevate the rich semantic understanding from 2D imagery to 3D representations, distilling high-dimensional spatial features onto 3D space. In our work, we are interested in connecting language with a dynamic modeling of the world. We show how to lift spatio-temporal features to a 4D representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. This enables an interactive interface where the user can spatiotemporally localize events in the video from text prompts.

| 112 | Gaussian-Det: Learning Closed-Surface Gaussians for 3D Object Detection | Hongru Yan,Yu Zheng,Yueqi Duan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Skins wrapping around our bodies, leathers covering over the sofa, sheet metal coating the car - it suggests that objects are enclosed by a series of continuous surfaces, which provides us with informative geometry prior for objectness deduction. In this paper, we propose Gaussian-Det which leverages Gaussian Splatting as surface representation for multi-view based 3D object detection. Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface closure of the object proposal. In this way, the surface information Gaussian-Det exploits serves as the prior on the quality and reliability of objectness and the information basis of proposal refinement. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Gaussian-Det outperforms various existing approaches, in terms of both average precision and recall.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01404](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01404) |
| 111 | DenseSplat: Densifying Gaussian Splatting SLAM with Neural Radiance Prior | Mingrui Li,Shuhong Liu,Tianchen Deng,Hongyu Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian SLAM systems excel in real-time rendering and fine-grained reconstruction compared to NeRF-based systems. However, their reliance on extensive keyframes is impractical for deployment in real-world robotic systems, which typically operate under sparse-view conditions that can result in substantial holes in the map. To address these challenges, we introduce DenseSplat, the first SLAM system that effectively combines the advantages of NeRF and 3DGS. DenseSplat utilizes sparse keyframes and NeRF priors for initializing primitives that densely populate maps and seamlessly fill gaps. It also implements geometry-aware primitive sampling and pruning strategies to manage granularity and enhance rendering efficiency. Moreover, DenseSplat integrates loop closure and bundle adjustment, significantly enhancing frame-to-frame tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate that DenseSplat achieves superior performance in tracking and mapping compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09111](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09111) |

Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a promising solution in 3D reconstruction due to its high-quality novel view synthesis and rapid rendering capabilities, positioning it as a valuable tool for a broad spectrum of applications. In particular, a GS-based representation, 2DGS, has shown potential for image fitting. In our work, we present \\textbf{L}arge \\textbf{I}mages are \\textbf{G}aussians (\\textbf{LIG}), which delves deeper into the application of 2DGS for image representations, addressing the challenge of fitting large images with 2DGS in the situation of numerous Gaussian points, through two distinct modifications: 1) we adopt a variant of representation and optimization strategy, facilitating the fitting of a large number of Gaussian points; 2) we propose a Level-of-Gaussian approach for reconstructing both coarse low-frequency initialization and fine high-frequency details. Consequently, we successfully represent large images as Gaussian points and achieve high-quality large image representation, demonstrating its efficacy across various types of large images.

RenderWorld employs Gaussian Splatting to represent 3D scenes and render 2D images greatly improves segmentation accuracy and reduces GPU memory consumption compared with NeRF-based methods.

Traditional image-based INRs employ neural networks to map pixel coordinates to RGB values, capturing shapes, colors, and textures within the network's weights. Recently, GaussianImage has been proposed as an alternative, using Gaussian functions instead of neural networks to achieve comparable quality and compression. Such a solution obtains a quality and compression ratio similar to classical INR models but does not allow image modification. In contrast, our work introduces a novel method, MiraGe, which uses mirror reflections to perceive 2D images in 3D space and employs flat-controlled Gaussians for precise 2D image editing. Our approach improves the rendering quality and allows realistic image modifications, including human-inspired perception of photos in the 3D world. Thanks to modeling images in 3D space, we obtain the illusion of 3D-based modification in 2D images. We also show that our Gaussian representation can be easily combined with a physics engine to produce physics-based modification of 2D images.

In this work, we rethink the set of 3D Gaussians as a random sample drawn from an underlying probability distribution describing the physical representation of the scene-in other words, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Under this view, we show that the 3D Gaussian updates can be converted as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) updates by simply introducing noise. We then rewrite the densification and pruning strategies in 3D Gaussian Splatting as simply a deterministic state transition of MCMC samples, removing these heuristics from the framework. To do so, we revise the 'cloning' of Gaussians into a relocalization scheme that approximately preserves sample probability. To encourage efficient use of Gaussians, we introduce a regularizer that promotes the removal of unused Gaussians. On various standard evaluation scenes, we show that our method provides improved rendering quality, easy control over the number of Gaussians, and robustness to initialization.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09591](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09591) |
| 106 | WeatherGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction in Adverse Weather Conditions via Gaussian Splatting | Chenghao Qian,Yuhu Guo,Wenjing Li,Gustav Markkula | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

In response, we propose a platform that leverages a 3D interactive facial avatar capable of displaying non-verbal feedback, including pain signals. This avatar is projected onto a stereoscopic, view-dependent 3D display, offering a more immersive and realistic simulated patient experience for pain assessment practice. However, there is no existing solution that dynamically predicts and projects interactive 3D facial avatars in real-time. To overcome this, we emphasize the need for a 3D display projection system that can project the facial avatar holographically, allowing users to interact with the avatar from any viewpoint. By incorporating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and real-time view-dependent calibration, we significantly improve the training environment for accurate pain recognition and assessment.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08085](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08085) |

For example, ray tracing is able to handle incoherent rays for advanced lighting effects, including shadows and reflections. To address this limitation, we introduce MeshSplats, a method which converts GS to a mesh-like format. Following the completion of training, MeshSplats transforms Gaussian elements into mesh faces, enabling rendering using ray tracing methods with all their associated benefits. Our model can be utilized immediately following transformation, yielding a mesh of slightly reduced quality without additional training. Furthermore, we can enhance the reconstruction quality through the application of a dedicated optimization algorithm that operates on mesh faces rather than Gaussian components.

However, its optimization process lacks explicit geometric constraints, leading to suboptimal geometric reconstruction in regions with sparse or no observational input views. In this work, we try to mitigate the issue by incorporating a pre-trained matching prior to the 3DGS optimization process. We introduce Flow Distillation Sampling (FDS), a technique that leverages pre-trained geometric knowledge to bolster the accuracy of the Gaussian radiance field. Our method employs a strategic sampling technique to target unobserved views adjacent to the input views, utilizing the optical flow calculated from the matching model (Prior Flow) to guide the flow analytically calculated from the 3DGS geometry (Radiance Flow). Comprehensive experiments in depth rendering, mesh reconstruction, and novel view synthesis showcase the significant advantages of FDS over state-of-the-art methods.

| 102 | EdgeGaussians -- 3D Edge Mapping via Gaussian Splatting | Kunal Chelani,Assia Benbihi,Torsten Sattler,Fredrik Kahl | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>With their meaningful geometry and their omnipresence in the 3D world, edges are extremely useful primitives in computer vision. 3D edges comprise of lines and curves, and methods to reconstruct them use either multi-view images or point clouds as input. State-of-the-art image-based methods first learn a 3D edge point cloud then fit 3D edges to it. The edge point cloud is obtained by learning a 3D neural implicit edge field from which the 3D edge points are sampled on a specific level set (0 or 1). However, such methods present two important drawbacks: i) it is not realistic to sample points on exact level sets due to float imprecision and training inaccuracies. Instead, they are sampled within a range of levels so the points do not lie accurately on the 3D edges and require further processing. ii) Such implicit representations are computationally expensive and require long training times. In this paper, we address these two limitations and propose a 3D edge mapping that is simpler, more efficient, and preserves accuracy. Our method learns explicitly the 3D edge points and their edge direction hence bypassing the need for point sampling. It casts a 3D edge point as the center of a 3D Gaussian and the edge direction as the principal axis of the Gaussian. Such a representation has the advantage of being not only geometrically meaningful but also compatible with the efficient training optimization defined in Gaussian Splatting. Results show that the proposed method produces edges as accurate and complete as the state-of-the-art while being an order of magnitude faster.

However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To achieve a compact size, we propose HAC++, which leverages the relationships between unorganized anchors and a structured hash grid, utilizing their mutual information for context modeling. Additionally, HAC++ captures intra-anchor contextual relationships to further enhance compression performance. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to precisely estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Moreover, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Overall, HAC++ achieves a remarkable size reduction of over 100X compared to vanilla 3DGS when averaged on all datasets, while simultaneously improving fidelity. It also delivers more than 20X size reduction compared to Scaffold-GS.

| 100 | PoI: Pixel of Interest for Novel View Synthesis Assisted Scene Coordinate Regression | Feifei Li,Qi Song,Chi Zhang,Hui Shuai,Rui Huang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The task of estimating camera poses can be enhanced through novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and Gaussian Splatting to increase the diversity and extension of training data. However, these techniques often produce rendered images with issues like blurring and ghosting, which compromise their reliability. These issues become particularly pronounced for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which estimate 3D coordinates at the pixel level. To mitigate the problems associated with unreliable rendered images, we introduce a novel filtering approach, which selectively extracts well-rendered pixels while discarding the inferior ones. This filter simultaneously measures the SCR model's real-time reprojection loss and gradient during training. Building on this filtering technique, we also develop a new strategy to improve scene coordinate regression using sparse inputs, drawing on successful applications of sparse input techniques in novel view synthesis.

| 99 | DreamCatalyst: Fast and High-Quality 3D Editing via Controlling Editability and Identity Preservation | Jiwook Kim,Seonho Lee,Jaeyo Shin,Jiho Choi,Hyunjung Shim | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks, leveraging diffusion models for 3D-consistent editing. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is \\textit{their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models}. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality. DreamCatalyst also surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing methods, establishing itself as an effective and model-agnostic 3D editing solution.

Conventional depth sensors often fail with transparent objects, resulting in incomplete or erroneous depth data. Existing depth completion methods struggle with interframe consistency and incorrectly model transparent objects as Lambertian surfaces, leading to poor depth reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose TranSplat, a surface embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting method tailored for transparent objects. TranSplat uses a latent diffusion model to generate surface embeddings that provide consistent and continuous representations, making it robust to changes in viewpoint and lighting. By integrating these surface embeddings with input RGB images, TranSplat effectively captures the complexities of transparent surfaces, enhancing the splatting of 3D Gaussians and improving depth completion. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world transparent object benchmarks, as well as robot grasping tasks, show that TranSplat achieves accurate and dense depth completion, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications.

However, most existing methods prioritize appearance consistency while neglecting underlying physical principles, leading to artifacts such as unrealistic deformations, unstable dynamics, and implausible objects interactions. Incorporating physics priors into generative models has become a crucial research direction to enhance structural integrity and motion realism. This survey provides a review of physics-aware generative methods, systematically analyzing how physical constraints are integrated into 3D and 4D generation.

| 95 | SIREN: Semantic, Initialization-Free Registration of Multi-Robot Gaussian Splatting Maps | Ola Shorinwa,Jiankai Sun,Mac Schwager,Anirudha Majumdar | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present SIREN for registration of multi-robot Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) maps, with zero access to camera poses, images, and inter-map transforms for initialization or fusion of local submaps. To realize these capabilities, SIREN harnesses the versatility and robustness of semantics in three critical ways to derive a rigorous registration pipeline for multi-robot GSplat maps. First, SIREN utilizes semantics to identify feature-rich regions of the local maps where the registration problem is better posed, eliminating the need for any initialization which is generally required in prior work. Second, SIREN identifies candidate correspondences between Gaussians in the local maps using robust semantic features, constituting the foundation for robust geometric optimization, coarsely aligning 3D Gaussian primitives extracted from the local maps. Third, this key step enables subsequent photometric refinement of the transformation between the submaps, where SIREN leverages novel-view synthesis in GSplat maps along with a semantics-based image filter to compute a high-accuracy non-rigid transformation for the generation of a high-fidelity fused map. We demonstrate the superior performance of SIREN compared to competing baselines across a range of real-world datasets, and in particular, across the most widely-used robot hardware platforms, including a manipulator, drone, and quadruped. In our experiments, SIREN achieves about 90x smaller rotation errors, 300x smaller translation errors, and 44x smaller scale errors in the most challenging scenes, where competing methods struggle. We will release the code and provide a link to the project page after the review process.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06519](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06519) |

To address this task, 1) we introduce Multi-view ControlNet (MVControl), a novel neural network architecture designed to enhance existing pre-trained multi-view diffusion models by integrating additional input conditions, such as edge, depth, normal, and scribble maps. Our innovation lies in the introduction of a conditioning module that controls the base diffusion model using both local and global embeddings, which are computed from the input condition images and camera poses. Once trained, MVControl is able to offer 3D diffusion guidance for optimization-based 3D generation. And, 2) we propose an efficient multi-stage 3D generation pipeline that leverages the benefits of recent large reconstruction models and score distillation algorithm. Building upon our MVControl architecture, we employ a unique hybrid diffusion guidance method to direct the optimization process. In pursuit of efficiency, we adopt 3D Gaussians as our representation instead of the commonly used implicit representations. We also pioneer the use of SuGaR, a hybrid representation that binds Gaussians to mesh triangle faces. This approach alleviates the issue of poor geometry in 3D Gaussians and enables the direct sculpting of fine-grained geometry on the mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization and enables the controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.

| 91 | PINGS: Gaussian Splatting Meets Distance Fields within a Point-Based Implicit Neural Map | Yue Pan,Xingguang Zhong,Liren Jin,Louis Wiesmann,Marija Popovi\xc4\x87,Jens Behley,Cyrill Stachniss | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Robots require high-fidelity reconstructions of their environment for effective operation. Such scene representations should be both, geometrically accurate and photorealistic to support downstream tasks. While this can be achieved by building distance fields from range sensors and radiance fields from cameras, the scalable incremental mapping of both fields consistently and at the same time with high quality remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel map representation that unifies a continuous signed distance field and a Gaussian splatting radiance field within an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map. By enforcing geometric consistency between these fields, we achieve mutual improvements by exploiting both modalities. We devise a LiDAR-visual SLAM system called PINGS using the proposed map representation and evaluate it on several challenging large-scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PINGS can incrementally build globally consistent distance and radiance fields encoded with a compact set of neural points. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PINGS achieves superior photometric and geometric rendering at novel views by leveraging the constraints from the distance field. Furthermore, by utilizing dense photometric cues and multi-view consistency from the radiance field, PINGS produces more accurate distance fields, leading to improved odometry estimation and mesh reconstruction.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05752](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05752) |

We present DEGAS, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based modeling method for full-body avatars with rich facial expressions. Trained on multiview videos of a given subject, our method learns a conditional variational autoencoder that takes both the body motion and facial expression as driving signals to generate Gaussian maps in the UV layout. To drive the facial expressions, instead of the commonly used 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) in 3D head avatars, we propose to adopt the expression latent space trained solely on 2D portrait images, bridging the gap between 2D talking faces and 3D avatars. Leveraging the rendering capability of 3DGS and the rich expressiveness of the expression latent space, the learned avatars can be reenacted to reproduce photorealistic rendering images with subtle and accurate facial expressions. Experiments on an existing dataset and our newly proposed dataset of full-body talking avatars demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We also propose an audio-driven extension of our method with the help of 2D talking faces, opening new possibilities for interactive AI agents.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10588](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10588) |
| 89 | Vision-in-the-loop Simulation for Deep Monocular Pose Estimation of UAV in Ocean Environment | Maneesha Wickramasuriya,Beomyeol Yu,Taeyoung Lee,Murray Snyder | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper proposes a vision-in-the-loop simulation environment for deep monocular pose estimation of a UAV operating in an ocean environment. Recently, a deep neural network with a transformer architecture has been successfully trained to estimate the pose of a UAV relative to the flight deck of a research vessel, overcoming several limitations of GPS-based approaches. However, validating the deep pose estimation scheme in an actual ocean environment poses significant challenges due to the limited availability of research vessels and the associated operational costs. To address these issues, we present a photo-realistic 3D virtual environment leveraging recent advancements in Gaussian splatting, a novel technique that represents 3D scenes by modeling image pixels as Gaussian distributions in 3D space, creating a lightweight and high-quality visual model from multiple viewpoints. This approach enables the creation of a virtual environment integrating multiple real-world images collected in situ. The resulting simulation enables the indoor testing of flight maneuvers while verifying all aspects of flight software, hardware, and the deep monocular pose estimation scheme. This approach provides a cost-effective solution for testing and validating the autonomous flight of shipboard UAVs, specifically focusing on vision-based control and estimation algorithms.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05409](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05409) |

We introduce a novel method that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with an implicit surface representation, enabling intuitive editing of recovered scenes through mesh manipulation. Starting with a set of input images and camera poses, our approach reconstructs the scene surface using a neural signed distance field. This neural surface acts as a geometric prior guiding the training of Gaussian Splatting components, ensuring their alignment with the scene geometry. To facilitate editing, we encode the visual and geometric information into a lightweight triangle soup proxy. Edits applied to the mesh extracted from the neural surface propagate seamlessly through this intermediate structure to update the recovered appearance. Unlike previous methods relying on the triangle soup proxy representation, our approach supports a wider range of modifications and fully leverages the mesh topology, enabling a more flexible and intuitive editing process.

However, traditional radiance field methods do not address the specific challenges inherent to 360-degree images. We present SC-OmniGS, a novel self-calibrating omnidirectional Gaussian splatting system for fast and accurate omnidirectional radiance field reconstruction using 360-degree images. Rather than converting 360-degree images to cube maps and performing perspective image calibration, we treat 360-degree images as a whole sphere and derive a mathematical framework that enables direct omnidirectional camera pose calibration accompanied by 3D Gaussians optimization. Furthermore, we introduce a differentiable omnidirectional camera model in order to rectify the distortion of real-world data for performance enhancement. Overall, the omnidirectional camera intrinsic model, extrinsic poses, and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized by minimizing weighted spherical photometric loss. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed SC-OmniGS is able to recover a high-quality radiance field from noisy camera poses or even no pose prior in challenging scenarios characterized by wide baselines and non-object-centric configurations. The noticeable performance gain in the real-world dataset captured by consumer-grade omnidirectional cameras verifies the effectiveness of our general omnidirectional camera model in reducing the distortion of 360-degree images.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04734](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04734) |
| 86 | High-Speed Dynamic 3D Imaging with Sensor Fusion Splatting | Zihao Zou,Ziyuan Qu,Xi Peng,Vivek Boominathan,Adithya Pediredla,Praneeth Chakravarthula | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Capturing and reconstructing high-speed dynamic 3D scenes has numerous applications in computer graphics, vision, and interdisciplinary fields such as robotics, aerodynamics, and evolutionary biology. However, achieving this using a single imaging modality remains challenging. For instance, traditional RGB cameras suffer from low frame rates, limited exposure times, and narrow baselines. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion approach using Gaussian splatting, which combines RGB, depth, and event cameras to capture and reconstruct deforming scenes at high speeds. The key insight of our method lies in leveraging the complementary strengths of these imaging modalities: RGB cameras capture detailed color information, event cameras record rapid scene changes with microsecond resolution, and depth cameras provide 3D scene geometry. To unify the underlying scene representation across these modalities, we represent the scene using deformable 3D Gaussians. To handle rapid scene movements, we jointly optimize the 3D Gaussian parameters and their temporal deformation fields by integrating data from all three sensor modalities. This fusion enables efficient, high-quality imaging of fast and complex scenes, even under challenging conditions such as low light, narrow baselines, or rapid motion. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets captured with our prototype sensor fusion setup demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving noticeable improvements in both rendering fidelity and structural accuracy.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04630](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04630) |
| 85 | Segment Any 3D Gaussians | Jiazhong Cen,Jiemin Fang,Chen Yang,Lingxi Xie,Xiaopeng Zhang,Wei Shen,Qi Tian | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper presents SAGA (Segment Any 3D GAussians), a highly efficient 3D promptable segmentation method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Given 2D visual prompts as input, SAGA can segment the corresponding 3D target represented by 3D Gaussians within 4 ms. This is achieved by attaching an scale-gated affinity feature to each 3D Gaussian to endow it a new property towards multi-granularity segmentation. Specifically, a scale-aware contrastive training strategy is proposed for the scale-gated affinity feature learning. It 1) distills the segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) from 2D masks into the affinity features and 2) employs a soft scale gate mechanism to deal with multi-granularity ambiguity in 3D segmentation through adjusting the magnitude of each feature channel according to a specified 3D physical scale. Evaluations demonstrate that SAGA achieves real-time multi-granularity segmentation with quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods. As one of the first methods addressing promptable segmentation in 3D-GS, the simplicity and effectiveness of SAGA pave the way for future advancements in this field.

| 84 | GS-LiDAR: Generating Realistic LiDAR Point Clouds with Panoramic Gaussian Splatting | Junzhe Jiang,Chun Gu,Yurui Chen,Li Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>LiDAR novel view synthesis (NVS) has emerged as a novel task within LiDAR simulation, offering valuable simulated point cloud data from novel viewpoints to aid in autonomous driving systems. However, existing LiDAR NVS methods typically rely on neural radiance fields (NeRF) as their 3D representation, which incurs significant computational costs in both training and rendering. Moreover, NeRF and its variants are designed for symmetrical scenes, making them ill-suited for driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose GS-LiDAR, a novel framework for generating realistic LiDAR point clouds with panoramic Gaussian splatting. Our approach employs 2D Gaussian primitives with periodic vibration properties, allowing for precise geometric reconstruction of both static and dynamic elements in driving scenarios. We further introduce a novel panoramic rendering technique with explicit ray-splat intersection, guided by panoramic LiDAR supervision. By incorporating intensity and ray-drop spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients into the Gaussian primitives, we enhance the realism of the rendered point clouds. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and nuScenes demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, as well as training and rendering efficiency.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13971](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13971) |
| 83 | RayGauss: Volumetric Gaussian-Based Ray Casting for Photorealistic Novel View Synthesis | Hugo Blanc,Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud,Alexis Paljic | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Differentiable volumetric rendering-based methods made significant progress in novel view synthesis. On one hand, innovative methods have replaced the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) network with locally parameterized structures, enabling high-quality renderings in a reasonable time. On the other hand, approaches have used differentiable splatting instead of NeRF's ray casting to optimize radiance fields rapidly using Gaussian kernels, allowing for fine adaptation to the scene. However, differentiable ray casting of irregularly spaced kernels has been scarcely explored, while splatting, despite enabling fast rendering times, is susceptible to clearly visible artifacts.  Our work closes this gap by providing a physically consistent formulation of the emitted radiance c and density \xcf\x83, decomposed with Gaussian functions associated with Spherical Gaussians/Harmonics for all-frequency colorimetric representation. We also introduce a method enabling differentiable ray casting of irregularly distributed Gaussians using an algorithm that integrates radiance fields slab by slab and leverages a BVH structure. This allows our approach to finely adapt to the scene while avoiding splatting artifacts. As a result, we achieve superior rendering quality compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining reasonable training times and achieving inference speeds of 25 FPS on the Blender dataset.

| 82 | GaussNav: Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation | Xiaohan Lei,Min Wang,Wengang Zhou,Houqiang Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In embodied vision, Instance ImageGoal Navigation (IIN) requires an agent to locate a specific object depicted in a goal image within an unexplored environment. The primary challenge of IIN arises from the need to recognize the target object across varying viewpoints while ignoring potential distractors. Existing map-based navigation methods typically use Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps, which lack detailed texture representation of a scene. Consequently, while BEV maps are effective for semantic-level visual navigation, they are struggling for instance-level tasks. To this end, we propose a new framework for IIN, Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation (GaussNav), which constructs a novel map representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The GaussNav framework enables the agent to memorize both the geometry and semantic information of the scene, as well as retain the textural features of objects. By matching renderings of similar objects with the target, the agent can accurately identify, ground, and navigate to the specified object. Our GaussNav framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement, with Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) increasing from 0.347 to 0.578 on the challenging Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset.

An alternative is Radio-Frequency (RF) signal spatial propagation modeling, which computes received signals given transceiver positions in a scene (e.g.s a conference room). We identify a fundamental trade-off between scalability and fidelity in the state-of-the-art method. To address this issue, we explore leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an advanced technique for the image synthesis of 3D scenes in real-time from arbitrary camera poses. By integrating domain-specific insights, we design three components for adapting 3DGS to the RF domain, including Gaussian-based RF scene representation, gradient-guided RF attribute learning, and RF-customized CUDA for ray tracing. Building on them, we develop RFSPM, an end-to-end framework for scalable RF signal Spatial Propagation Modeling. We evaluate RFSPM in four field studies and two applications across RFID, BLE, LoRa, and 5G, covering diverse frequencies, antennas, signals, and scenes. The results show that RFSPM matches the fidelity of the state-of-the-art method while reducing data requirements, training GPU-hours, and inference latency by up to 9.8\\,$\\times$, 18.6\\,$\\times$, and 84.4\\,$\\times$, respectively.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01826](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01826) |

However, these policies often encounter challenges when deployed in real-world environments due to sim-to-real gaps, as simulators typically fail to replicate visual realism and complex real-world geometry. Moreover, the lack of realistic visual rendering limits the ability of these policies to support high-level tasks requiring RGB-based perception like ego-centric navigation. This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive "digital twin" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves RGB-only sim-to-real policy transfer. Additionally, our framework facilitates the rapid adaptation of robot policies with effective exploration capability in complex new environments, highlighting its potential for applications in households and factories.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01536](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01536) |

However, reflective object reconstruction remains challenging, lacking a proper solution to achieve real-time, high-quality rendering while accommodating inter-reflection. To fill this gap, we introduce a Reflective Gaussian splatting (Ref-Gaussian) framework characterized with two components: (I) Physically based deferred rendering that empowers the rendering equation with pixel-level material properties via formulating split-sum approximation; (II) Gaussian-grounded inter-reflection that realizes the desired inter-reflection function within a Gaussian splatting paradigm for the first time. To enhance geometry modeling, we further introduce material-aware normal propagation and an initial per-Gaussian shading stage, along with 2D Gaussian primitives. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that Ref-Gaussian surpasses existing approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and compute efficiency. Further, we show that our method serves as a unified solution for both reflective and non-reflective scenes, going beyond the previous alternatives focusing on only reflective scenes. Also, we illustrate that Ref-Gaussian supports more applications such as relighting and editing.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19282](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19282) |

Addressing this, we introduce a method to generate distributions of camera poses conditioned on textual descriptions, facilitating robust reasoning for broadly defined concepts.  Our approach employs a diffusion-based architecture to refine noisy 6DoF camera poses towards plausible locations, with conditional signals derived from pre-trained text encoders. Integration with the pretrained Vision-Language Model, CLIP, establishes a strong linkage between text descriptions and pose distributions. Enhancement of localization accuracy is achieved by rendering candidate poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, which corrects misaligned samples through visual reasoning.

| 77 | Radiant Foam: Real-Time Differentiable Ray Tracing | Shrisudhan Govindarajan,Daniel Rebain,Kwang Moo Yi,Andrea Tagliasacchi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Research on differentiable scene representations is consistently moving towards more efficient, real-time models. Recently, this has led to the popularization of splatting methods, which eschew the traditional ray-based rendering of radiance fields in favor of rasterization. This has yielded a significant improvement in rendering speeds due to the efficiency of rasterization algorithms and hardware, but has come at a cost: the approximations that make rasterization efficient also make implementation of light transport phenomena like reflection and refraction much more difficult. We propose a novel scene representation which avoids these approximations, but keeps the efficiency and reconstruction quality of splatting by leveraging a decades-old efficient volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm which has been largely overlooked in recent computer vision research. The resulting model, which we name Radiant Foam, achieves rendering speed and quality comparable to Gaussian Splatting, without the constraints of rasterization. Unlike ray traced Gaussian models that use hardware ray tracing acceleration, our method requires no special hardware or APIs beyond the standard features of a programmable GPU.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01157](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01157) |

These approaches create a 3D radiance field, parameterized by per-pixel 3D Gaussian primitives, from just a few images in a single forward pass. However, unlike multi-view methods that benefit from cross-view correspondences, 3D scene reconstruction with a single-view image remains an underexplored area. In this work, we introduce CATSplat, a novel generalizable transformer-based framework designed to break through the inherent constraints in monocular settings. First, we propose leveraging textual guidance from a visual-language model to complement insufficient information from a single image. By incorporating scene-specific contextual details from text embeddings through cross-attention, we pave the way for context-aware 3D scene reconstruction beyond relying solely on visual cues. Moreover, we advocate utilizing spatial guidance from 3D point features toward comprehensive geometric understanding under single-view settings. With 3D priors, image features can capture rich structural insights for predicting 3D Gaussians without multi-view techniques. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CATSplat in single-view 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality novel view synthesis.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12906](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12906) |
| 75 | Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity | Tianqi Shen,Shaohua Liu,Jiaqi Feng,Ziye Ma,Ning An | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619) |

| 73 | EmoTalkingGaussian: Continuous Emotion-conditioned Talking Head Synthesis | Junuk Cha,Seongro Yoon,Valeriya Strizhkova,Francois Bremond,Seungryul Baek | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian splatting-based talking head synthesis has recently gained attention for its ability to render high-fidelity images with real-time inference speed. However, since it is typically trained on only a short video that lacks the diversity in facial emotions, the resultant talking heads struggle to represent a wide range of emotions. To address this issue, we propose a lip-aligned emotional face generator and leverage it to train our EmoTalkingGaussian model. It is able to manipulate facial emotions conditioned on continuous emotion values (i.e., valence and arousal); while retaining synchronization of lip movements with input audio. Additionally, to achieve the accurate lip synchronization for in-the-wild audio, we introduce a self-supervised learning method that leverages a text-to-speech network and a visual-audio synchronization network. We experiment our EmoTalkingGaussian on publicly available videos and have obtained better results than state-of-the-arts in terms of image quality (measured in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), emotion expression (measured in V-RMSE, A-RMSE, V-SA, A-SA, Emotion Accuracy), and lip synchronization (measured in LMD, Sync-E, Sync-C), respectively.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00654](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00654) |
| 72 | Gaussians on their Way: Wasserstein-Constrained 4D Gaussian Splatting with State-Space Modeling | Junli Deng,Yihao Luo | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Dynamic scene rendering has taken a leap forward with the rise of 4D Gaussian Splatting, but there's still one elusive challenge: how to make 3D Gaussians move through time as naturally as they would in the real world, all while keeping the motion smooth and consistent. In this paper, we unveil a fresh approach that blends state-space modeling with Wasserstein geometry, paving the way for a more fluid and coherent representation of dynamic scenes. We introduce a State Consistency Filter that merges prior predictions with the current observations, enabling Gaussians to stay true to their way over time. We also employ Wasserstein distance regularization to ensure smooth, consistent updates of Gaussian parameters, reducing motion artifacts. Lastly, we leverage Wasserstein geometry to capture both translational motion and shape deformations, creating a more physically plausible model for dynamic scenes. Our approach guides Gaussians along their natural way in the Wasserstein space, achieving smoother, more realistic motion and stronger temporal coherence. Experimental results show significant improvements in rendering quality and efficiency, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00333](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00333) |
| 71 | Lifting by Gaussians: A Simple, Fast and Flexible Method for 3D Instance Segmentation | Rohan Chacko,Nicolai Haeni,Eldar Khaliullin,Lin Sun,Douglas Lee | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce Lifting By Gaussians (LBG), a novel approach for open-world instance segmentation of 3D Gaussian Splatted Radiance Fields (3DGS). Recently, 3DGS Fields have emerged as a highly efficient and explicit alternative to Neural Field-based methods for high-quality Novel View Synthesis. Our 3D instance segmentation method directly lifts 2D segmentation masks from SAM (alternately FastSAM, etc.), together with features from CLIP and DINOv2, directly fusing them onto 3DGS (or similar Gaussian radiance fields such as 2DGS). Unlike previous approaches, LBG requires no per-scene training, allowing it to operate seamlessly on any existing 3DGS reconstruction. Our approach is not only an order of magnitude faster and simpler than existing approaches; it is also highly modular, enabling 3D semantic segmentation of existing 3DGS fields without requiring a specific parametrization of the 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, our technique achieves superior semantic segmentation for 2D semantic novel view synthesis and 3D asset extraction results while maintaining flexibility and efficiency. We further introduce a novel approach to evaluate individually segmented 3D assets from 3D radiance field segmentation methods.</details> | February 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00173](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00173) |

While recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved SLAM with high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering, these systems struggle with accurate depth and surface reconstruction due to multi-view inconsistencies. Simply incorporating SLAM and 3DGS leads to mismatches between the reconstructed frames. In this work, we present Endo-2DTAM, a real-time endoscopic SLAM system with 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) to address these challenges. Endo-2DTAM incorporates a surface normal-aware pipeline, which consists of tracking, mapping, and bundle adjustment modules for geometrically accurate reconstruction. Our robust tracking module combines point-to-point and point-to-plane distance metrics, while the mapping module utilizes normal consistency and depth distortion to enhance surface reconstruction quality. We also introduce a pose-consistent strategy for efficient and geometrically coherent keyframe sampling. Extensive experiments on public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that Endo-2DTAM achieves an RMSE of $1.87\\pm 0.63$ mm for depth reconstruction of surgical scenes while maintaining computationally efficient tracking, high-quality visual appearance, and real-time rendering. Our code will be released at github.com/lastbasket/Endo-2DTAM.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19319](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19319) |

This representation offers numerous advantages, including rapid training and rendering. However, a significant limitation of 3DGS is the challenge of incorporating light and shadow reflections, primarily due to the utilization of rasterization rather than ray tracing for rendering. This paper introduces RaySplats, a model that employs ray-tracing based Gaussian Splatting. Rather than utilizing the projection of Gaussians, our method employs a ray-tracing mechanism, operating directly on Gaussian primitives represented by confidence ellipses with RGB colors. In practice, we compute the intersection between ellipses and rays to construct ray-tracing algorithms, facilitating the incorporation of meshes with Gaussian Splatting models and the addition of lights, shadows, and other related effects.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19196](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19196) |
| 68 | VoD-3DGS: View-opacity-Dependent 3D Gaussian Splatting | Mateusz Nowak,Wojciech Jarosz,Peter Chin | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reconstructing a 3D scene from images is challenging due to the different ways light interacts with surfaces depending on the viewer's position and the surface's material. In classical computer graphics, materials can be classified as diffuse or specular, interacting with light differently. The standard 3D Gaussian Splatting model struggles to represent view-dependent content, since it cannot differentiate an object within the scene from the light interacting with its specular surfaces, which produce highlights or reflections. In this paper, we propose to extend the 3D Gaussian Splatting model by introducing an additional symmetric matrix to enhance the opacity representation of each 3D Gaussian. This improvement allows certain Gaussians to be suppressed based on the viewer's perspective, resulting in a more accurate representation of view-dependent reflections and specular highlights without compromising the scene's integrity. By allowing the opacity to be view dependent, our enhanced model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Mip-Nerf, Tanks&Temples, Deep Blending, and Nerf-Synthetic datasets without a significant loss in rendering speed, achieving >60FPS, and only incurring a minimal increase in memory used.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17978](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17978) |
| 67 | JGHand: Joint-Driven Animatable Hand Avater via 3D Gaussian Splatting | Zhoutao Sun,Xukun Shen,Yong Hu,Yuyou Zhong,Xueyang Zhou | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Since hands are the primary interface in daily interactions, modeling high-quality digital human hands and rendering realistic images is a critical research problem. Furthermore, considering the requirements of interactive and rendering applications, it is essential to achieve real-time rendering and driveability of the digital model without compromising rendering quality. Thus, we propose Jointly 3D Gaussian Hand (JGHand), a novel joint-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based hand representation that renders high-fidelity hand images in real-time for various poses and characters. Distinct from existing articulated neural rendering techniques, we introduce a differentiable process for spatial transformations based on 3D key points. This process supports deformations from the canonical template to a mesh with arbitrary bone lengths and poses. Additionally, we propose a real-time shadow simulation method based on per-pixel depth to simulate self-occlusion shadows caused by finger movements. Finally, we embed the hand prior and propose an animatable 3DGS representation of the hand driven solely by 3D key points. We validate the effectiveness of each component of our approach through comprehensive ablation studies. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that JGHand achieves real-time rendering speeds with enhanced quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19088](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19088) |
| 66 | GEVO: Memory-Efficient Monocular Visual Odometry Using Gaussians | Dasong Gao,Peter Zhi Xuan Li,Vivienne Sze,Sertac Karaman | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Constructing a high-fidelity representation of the 3D scene using a monocular camera can enable a wide range of applications on mobile devices, such as micro-robots, smartphones, and AR/VR headsets. On these devices, memory is often limited in capacity and its access often dominates the consumption of compute energy. Although Gaussian Splatting (GS) allows for high-fidelity reconstruction of 3D scenes, current GS-based SLAM is not memory efficient as a large number of past images is stored to retrain Gaussians for reducing catastrophic forgetting. These images often require two-orders-of-magnitude higher memory than the map itself and thus dominate the total memory usage. In this work, we present GEVO, a GS-based monocular SLAM framework that achieves comparable fidelity as prior methods by rendering (instead of storing) them from the existing map. Novel Gaussian initialization and optimization techniques are proposed to remove artifacts from the map and delay the degradation of the rendered images over time. Across a variety of environments, GEVO achieves comparable map fidelity while reducing the memory overhead to around 58 MBs, which is up to 94x lower than prior works.</details> | September 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09295](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09295) |
| 65 | FeatureGS: Eigenvalue-Feature Optimization in 3D Gaussian Splatting for Geometrically Accurate and Artifact-Reduced Reconstruction | Miriam J\xc3\xa4ger,Markus Hillemann,Boris Jutzi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach for 3D scene reconstruction using 3D Gaussians. However, neither the centers nor surfaces of the Gaussians are accurately aligned to the object surface, complicating their direct use in point cloud and mesh reconstruction. Additionally, 3DGS typically produces floater artifacts, increasing the number of Gaussians and storage requirements. To address these issues, we present FeatureGS, which incorporates an additional geometric loss term based on an eigenvalue-derived 3D shape feature into the optimization process of 3DGS. The goal is to improve geometric accuracy and enhance properties of planar surfaces with reduced structural entropy in local 3D neighborhoods.We present four alternative formulations for the geometric loss term based on 'planarity' of Gaussians, as well as 'planarity', 'omnivariance', and 'eigenentropy' of Gaussian neighborhoods. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluations on 15 scenes of the DTU benchmark dataset focusing on following key aspects: Geometric accuracy and artifact-reduction, measured by the Chamfer distance, and memory efficiency, evaluated by the total number of Gaussians. Additionally, rendering quality is monitored by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio. FeatureGS achieves a 30 % improvement in geometric accuracy, reduces the number of Gaussians by 90 %, and suppresses floater artifacts, while maintaining comparable photometric rendering quality. The geometric loss with 'planarity' from Gaussians provides the highest geometric accuracy, while 'omnivariance' in Gaussian neighborhoods reduces floater artifacts and number of Gaussians the most. This makes FeatureGS a strong method for geometrically accurate, artifact-reduced and memory-efficient 3D scene reconstruction, enabling the direct use of Gaussian centers for geometric representation.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17655](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17655) |
| 64 | LUDVIG: Learning-free Uplifting of 2D Visual features to Gaussian Splatting scenes | Juliette Marrie,Romain Menegaux,Michael Arbel,Diane Larlus,Julien Mairal | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We address the problem of extending the capabilities of vision foundation models such as DINO, SAM, and CLIP, to 3D tasks. Specifically, we introduce a novel method to uplift 2D image features into Gaussian Splatting representations of 3D scenes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on minimizing a reconstruction loss, our method employs a simpler and more efficient feature aggregation technique, augmented by a graph diffusion mechanism. Graph diffusion refines 3D features, such as coarse segmentation masks, by leveraging 3D geometry and pairwise similarities induced by DINOv2. Our approach achieves performance comparable to the state of the art on multiple downstream tasks while delivering significant speed-ups. Notably, we obtain competitive segmentation results using generic DINOv2 features, despite DINOv2 not being trained on millions of annotated segmentation masks like SAM. When applied to CLIP features, our method demonstrates strong performance in open-vocabulary object localization tasks, highlighting the versatility of our approach.</details> | October 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14462](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14462) |
| 63 | DiffSplat: Repurposing Image Diffusion Models for Scalable Gaussian Splat Generation | Chenguo Lin,Panwang Pan,Bangbang Yang,Zeming Li,Yadong Mu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advancements in 3D content generation from text or a single image struggle with limited high-quality 3D datasets and inconsistency from 2D multi-view generation. We introduce DiffSplat, a novel 3D generative framework that natively generates 3D Gaussian splats by taming large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. It differs from previous 3D generative models by effectively utilizing web-scale 2D priors while maintaining 3D consistency in a unified model. To bootstrap the training, a lightweight reconstruction model is proposed to instantly produce multi-view Gaussian splat grids for scalable dataset curation. In conjunction with the regular diffusion loss on these grids, a 3D rendering loss is introduced to facilitate 3D coherence across arbitrary views. The compatibility with image diffusion models enables seamless adaptions of numerous techniques for image generation to the 3D realm. Extensive experiments reveal the superiority of DiffSplat in text- and image-conditioned generation tasks and downstream applications. Thorough ablation studies validate the efficacy of each critical design choice and provide insights into the underlying mechanism.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16764](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16764) |
| 62 | Deformable Beta Splatting | Rong Liu,Dylan Sun,Meida Chen,Yue Wang,Andrew Feng | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced radiance field reconstruction by enabling real-time rendering. However, its reliance on Gaussian kernels for geometry and low-order Spherical Harmonics (SH) for color encoding limits its ability to capture complex geometries and diverse colors. We introduce Deformable Beta Splatting (DBS), a deformable and compact approach that enhances both geometry and color representation. DBS replaces Gaussian kernels with deformable Beta Kernels, which offer bounded support and adaptive frequency control to capture fine geometric details with higher fidelity while achieving better memory efficiency. In addition, we extended the Beta Kernel to color encoding, which facilitates improved representation of diffuse and specular components, yielding superior results compared to SH-based methods. Furthermore, Unlike prior densification techniques that depend on Gaussian properties, we mathematically prove that adjusting regularized opacity alone ensures distribution-preserved Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), independent of the splatting kernel type. Experimental results demonstrate that DBS achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while utilizing only 45% of the parameters and rendering 1.5x faster than 3DGS-based methods. Notably, for the first time, splatting-based methods outperform state-of-the-art Neural Radiance Fields, highlighting the superior performance and efficiency of DBS for real-time radiance field rendering.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18630](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18630) |
| 61 | PEP-GS: Perceptually-Enhanced Precise Structured 3D Gaussians for View-Adaptive Rendering | Junxi Jin,Xiulai Li,Haiping Huang,Lianjun Liu,Yujie Sun,Boyi Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has achieved significant success in real-time, high-quality 3D scene rendering. However, it faces several challenges, including Gaussian redundancy, limited ability to capture view-dependent effects, and difficulties in handling complex lighting and specular reflections. Additionally, methods that use spherical harmonics for color representation often struggle to effectively capture specular highlights and anisotropic components, especially when modeling view-dependent colors under complex lighting conditions, leading to insufficient contrast and unnatural color saturation. To address these limitations, we introduce PEP-GS, a perceptually-enhanced framework that dynamically predicts Gaussian attributes, including opacity, color, and covariance. We replace traditional spherical harmonics with a Hierarchical Granular-Structural Attention mechanism, which enables more accurate modeling of complex view-dependent color effects and specular highlights. By employing a stable and interpretable framework for opacity and covariance estimation, PEP-GS avoids the removal of essential Gaussians prematurely, ensuring a more accurate scene representation. Furthermore, perceptual optimization is applied to the final rendered images, enhancing perceptual consistency across different views and ensuring high-quality renderings with improved texture fidelity and fine-scale detail preservation. Experimental results demonstrate that PEP-GS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving view-dependent effects, specular reflections, and fine-scale details.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05731](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05731) |
| 60 | 3DGS$^2$: Near Second-order Converging 3D Gaussian Splatting | Lei Lan,Tianjia Shao,Zixuan Lu,Yu Zhang,Chenfanfu Jiang,Yin Yang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a mainstream solution for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. By explicitly encoding a 3D scene using a collection of Gaussian kernels, 3DGS achieves high-quality rendering with superior efficiency. As a learning-based approach, 3DGS training has been dealt with the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which offers at most linear convergence. Consequently, training often requires tens of minutes, even with GPU acceleration. This paper introduces a (near) second-order convergent training algorithm for 3DGS, leveraging its unique properties. Our approach is inspired by two key observations. First, the attributes of a Gaussian kernel contribute independently to the image-space loss, which endorses isolated and local optimization algorithms. We exploit this by splitting the optimization at the level of individual kernel attributes, analytically constructing small-size Newton systems for each parameter group, and efficiently solving these systems on GPU threads. This achieves Newton-like convergence per training image without relying on the global Hessian. Second, kernels exhibit sparse and structured coupling across input images. This property allows us to effectively utilize spatial information to mitigate overshoot during stochastic training. Our method converges an order faster than standard GPU-based 3DGS training, requiring over $10\\times$ fewer iterations while maintaining or surpassing the quality of the compared with the SGD-based 3DGS reconstructions.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13975](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13975) |

Despite their impressive performance, they confront challenges due to the limitation of structure-from-motion (SfM) methods on acquiring accurate scene initialization, or the inefficiency of densification strategy. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework EasySplat to achieve high-quality 3DGS modeling. Instead of using SfM for scene initialization, we employ a novel method to release the power of large-scale pointmap approaches. Specifically, we propose an efficient grouping strategy based on view similarity, and use robust pointmap priors to obtain high-quality point clouds and camera poses for 3D scene initialization. After obtaining a reliable scene structure, we propose a novel densification approach that adaptively splits Gaussian primitives based on the average shape of neighboring Gaussian ellipsoids, utilizing KNN scheme. In this way, the proposed method tackles the limitation on initialization and optimization, leading to an efficient and accurate 3DGS modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EasySplat outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in handling novel view synthesis.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01003](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01003) |

To this end, existing approaches utilize vector quantization (VQ) to project pixels onto a discrete codebook and reconstruct images from the discrete representation. However, compared with the continuous latent space, the limited discrete codebook space significantly restrict the representational ability of these image tokenizers. In this paper, we propose GaussianToken: An Effective Image Tokenizer with 2D Gaussian Splatting as a solution. We first represent the encoded samples as multiple flexible featured 2D Gaussians characterized by positions, rotation angles, scaling factors, and feature coefficients. We adopt the standard quantization for the Gaussian features and then concatenate the quantization results with the other intrinsic Gaussian parameters before the corresponding splatting operation and the subsequent decoding module. In general, GaussianToken integrates the local influence of 2D Gaussian distribution into the discrete space and thus enhances the representation capability of the image tokenizer. Competitive reconstruction performances on CIFAR, Mini-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

However, 3DGS training requires a known camera pose for each input view, typically obtained by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. Pioneering works have attempted to relax this restriction but still face difficulties when handling long sequences with complex camera trajectories. In this work, we propose Rob-GS, a robust framework to progressively estimate camera poses and optimize 3DGS for arbitrarily long video sequences. Leveraging the inherent continuity of videos, we design an adjacent pose tracking method to ensure stable pose estimation between consecutive frames. To handle arbitrarily long inputs, we adopt a "divide and conquer" scheme that adaptively splits the video sequence into several segments and optimizes them separately. Extensive experiments on the Tanks and Temples dataset and our collected real-world dataset show that our Rob-GS outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15096](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15096) |

Existing approaches typically require monocular videos or calibrated multi-view images as inputs, whose applicability could be weakened in real-world scenarios with arbitrary and/or unknown camera poses. In this paper, we aim to generate the set of 3DGS attributes via a diffusion-based framework conditioned on human priors extracted from a single image. Specifically, we begin with carefully integrated human-centric feature extraction procedures to deduce informative conditioning signals. Based on our empirical observations that jointly learning the whole 3DGS attributes is challenging to optimize, we design a multi-stage generation strategy to obtain different types of 3DGS attributes. To facilitate the training process, we investigate constructing proxy ground-truth 3D Gaussian attributes as high-quality attribute-level supervision signals.

While such sanitized conditions simplify evaluation, they fail to capture the unpredictable, noisy complexities of real-world environments. Dynamic motion, sensor imperfections, and synchronization perturbations lead to sharp performance declines when these models are deployed in practice, revealing an urgent need for frameworks that embrace and excel under real-world noise. To bridge this gap, we tackle three core challenges: scalable data generation, comprehensive benchmarking, and model robustness enhancement. First, we introduce a scalable noisy data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse datasets simulating complex motion, sensor imperfections, and synchronization errors. Second, we leverage this pipeline to create Robust-Ego3D, a benchmark rigorously designed to expose noise-induced performance degradation, highlighting the limitations of current learning-based methods in ego-motion accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality.

Leveraging point rendering via Gaussian Splatting, we develop techniques of Partial Gaussian Initialization, Zero-shot Fractal Completion, and Point Cloud Extraction that utilize priors from pre-trained 2D diffusion models to infer missing regions and extract uniform completed point clouds. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world scanned point clouds demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in completing a variety of objects.

In this paper, we introduce Micro-macro Wavelet-based Gaussian Splatting (MW-GS), a novel approach designed to enhance 3D reconstruction by disentangling scene representations into global, refined, and intrinsic components. The proposed method features two key innovations: Micro-macro Projection, which allows Gaussian points to capture details from feature maps across multiple scales with enhanced diversity; and Wavelet-based Sampling, which leverages frequency domain information to refine feature representations and significantly improve the modeling of scene appearances. Additionally, we incorporate a Hierarchical Residual Fusion Network to seamlessly integrate these features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MW-GS delivers state-of-the-art rendering performance, surpassing existing methods.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14231](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14231) |
| 50 | HAMMER: Heterogeneous, Multi-Robot Semantic Gaussian Splatting | Javier Yu,Timothy Chen,Mac Schwager | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting offers expressive scene reconstruction, modeling a broad range of visual, geometric, and semantic information. However, efficient real-time map reconstruction with data streamed from multiple robots and devices remains a challenge. To that end, we propose HAMMER, a server-based collaborative Gaussian Splatting method that leverages widely available ROS communication infrastructure to generate 3D, metric-semantic maps from asynchronous robot data-streams with no prior knowledge of initial robot positions and varying on-device pose estimators. HAMMER consists of (i) a frame alignment module that transforms local SLAM poses and image data into a global frame and requires no prior relative pose knowledge, and (ii) an online module for training semantic 3DGS maps from streaming data. HAMMER handles mixed perception modes, adjusts automatically for variations in image pre-processing among different devices, and distills CLIP semantic codes into the 3D scene for open-vocabulary language queries. In our real-world experiments, HAMMER creates higher-fidelity maps (2x) compared to competing baselines and is useful for downstream tasks, such as semantic goal-conditioned navigation (e.g., ``go to the couch").

| 49 | 3DGSR: Implicit Surface Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Xiaoyang Lyu,Yang-Tian Sun,Yi-Hua Huang,Xiuzhe Wu,Ziyi Yang,Yilun Chen,Jiangmiao Pang,Xiaojuan Qi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we present an implicit surface reconstruction method with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), namely 3DGSR, that allows for accurate 3D reconstruction with intricate details while inheriting the high efficiency and rendering quality of 3DGS. The key insight is incorporating an implicit signed distance field (SDF) within 3D Gaussians to enable them to be aligned and jointly optimized. First, we introduce a differentiable SDF-to-opacity transformation function that converts SDF values into corresponding Gaussians' opacities. This function connects the SDF and 3D Gaussians, allowing for unified optimization and enforcing surface constraints on the 3D Gaussians. During learning, optimizing the 3D Gaussians provides supervisory signals for SDF learning, enabling the reconstruction of intricate details. However, this only provides sparse supervisory signals to the SDF at locations occupied by Gaussians, which is insufficient for learning a continuous SDF. Then, to address this limitation, we incorporate volumetric rendering and align the rendered geometric attributes (depth, normal) with those derived from 3D Gaussians. This consistency regularization introduces supervisory signals to locations not covered by discrete 3D Gaussians, effectively eliminating redundant surfaces outside the Gaussian sampling range. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our 3DGSR method enables high-quality 3D surface reconstruction while preserving the efficiency and rendering quality of 3DGS. Besides, our method competes favorably with leading surface reconstruction techniques while offering a more efficient learning process and much better rendering qualities. The code will be available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/3DGSR.</details> | April 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00409](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00409) |

To address this, we propose MultiDreamer3D that can generate coherent multi-concept 3D content in a divide-and-conquer manner. First, we generate 3D bounding boxes using an LLM-based layout controller. Next, a selective point cloud generator creates coarse point clouds for each concept. These point clouds are placed in the 3D bounding boxes and initialized into 3D Gaussian Splatting with concept labels, enabling precise identification of concept attributions in 2D projections. Finally, we refine 3D Gaussians via concept-aware interval score matching, guided by concept-aware diffusion. Our experimental results show that MultiDreamer3D not only ensures object presence and preserves the distinct identities of each concept but also successfully handles complex cases such as property change or interaction. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the multi-concept customization in 3D.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13449](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13449) |
| 47 | GeomGS: LiDAR-Guided Geometry-Aware Gaussian Splatting for Robot Localization | Jaewon Lee,Mangyu Kong,Minseong Park,Euntai Kim | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Mapping and localization are crucial problems in robotics and autonomous driving. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled precise 3D mapping and scene understanding by rendering photo-realistic images. However, existing 3DGS methods often struggle to accurately reconstruct a 3D map that reflects the actual scale and geometry of the real world, which degrades localization performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS method called Geometry-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GeomGS). This method fully integrates LiDAR data into 3D Gaussian primitives via a probabilistic approach, as opposed to approaches that only use LiDAR as initial points or introduce simple constraints for Gaussian points. To this end, we introduce a Geometric Confidence Score (GCS), which identifies the structural reliability of each Gaussian point. The GCS is optimized simultaneously with Gaussians under probabilistic distance constraints to construct a precise structure. Furthermore, we propose a novel localization method that fully utilizes both the geometric and photometric properties of GeomGS. Our GeomGS demonstrates state-of-the-art geometric and localization performance across several benchmarks, while also improving photometric performance.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13417](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13417) |
| 46 | VIGS SLAM: IMU-based Large-Scale 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM | Gyuhyeon Pak,Euntai Kim | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, map representations based on radiance fields such as 3D Gaussian Splatting and NeRF, which excellent for realistic depiction, have attracted considerable attention, leading to attempts to combine them with SLAM. While these approaches can build highly realistic maps, large-scale SLAM still remains a challenge because they require a large number of Gaussian images for mapping and adjacent images as keyframes for tracking. We propose a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method, VIGS SLAM, that utilizes sensor fusion of RGB-D and IMU sensors for large-scale indoor environments. To reduce the computational load of 3DGS-based tracking, we adopt an ICP-based tracking framework that combines IMU preintegration to provide a good initial guess for accurate pose estimation. Our proposed method is the first to propose that Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM can be effectively performed in large-scale environments by integrating IMU sensor measurements. This proposal not only enhances the performance of Gaussian Splatting SLAM beyond room-scale scenarios but also achieves SLAM performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in large-scale indoor environments.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13402](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13402) |
| 45 | Sketch and Patch: Efficient 3D Gaussian Representation for Man-Made Scenes | Yuang Shi,Simone Gasparini,G\xc3\xa9raldine Morin,Chenggang Yang,Wei Tsang Ooi | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising representation for photorealistic rendering of 3D scenes. However, its high storage requirements pose significant challenges for practical applications. We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics that are analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- Like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features like edges and contours; While other Gaussians represent broader, smoother regions, that are analogous to broader brush strokes that add volume and depth to a painting. Based on this observation, we propose a novel hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which define scene boundaries, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover smooth regions. Sketch Gaussians are efficiently encoded using parametric models, leveraging their geometric coherence, while Patch Gaussians undergo optimized pruning, retraining, and vector quantization to maintain volumetric consistency and storage efficiency. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrates that this structure-aware approach achieves up to 32.62% improvement in PSNR, 19.12% in SSIM, and 45.41% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes, and correspondingly, for an indoor scene, our model maintains the visual quality with 2.3% of the original model size.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13045](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13045) |

In this work, we explore using 2D Gaussian splats as a new primitive for representing videos. We propose GSVC, an approach to learning a set of 2D Gaussian splats that can effectively represent and compress video frames. GSVC incorporates the following techniques: (i) To exploit temporal redundancy among adjacent frames, which can speed up training and improve the compression efficiency, we predict the Gaussian splats of a frame based on its previous frame; (ii) To control the trade-offs between file size and quality, we remove Gaussian splats with low contribution to the video quality; (iii) To capture dynamics in videos, we randomly add Gaussian splats to fit content with large motion or newly-appeared objects; (iv) To handle significant changes in the scene, we detect key frames based on loss differences during the learning process. Experiment results show that GSVC achieves good rate-distortion trade-offs, comparable to state-of-the-art video codecs such as AV1 and VVC, and a rendering speed of 1500 fps for a 1920x1080 video.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12060](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12060) |
| 43 | Volumetrically Consistent 3D Gaussian Rasterization | Chinmay Talegaonkar,Yash Belhe,Ravi Ramamoorthi,Nicholas Antipa | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic view synthesis at high inference speeds. However, its splatting-based rendering model makes several approximations to the rendering equation, reducing physical accuracy. We show that splatting and its approximations are unnecessary, even within a rasterizer; we instead volumetrically integrate 3D Gaussians directly to compute the transmittance across them analytically. We use this analytic transmittance to derive more physically-accurate alpha values than 3DGS, which can directly be used within their framework. The result is a method that more closely follows the volume rendering equation (similar to ray-tracing) while enjoying the speed benefits of rasterization. Our method represents opaque surfaces with higher accuracy and fewer points than 3DGS. This enables it to outperform 3DGS for view synthesis (measured in SSIM and LPIPS). Being volumetrically consistent also enables our method to work out of the box for tomography. We match the state-of-the-art 3DGS-based tomography method with fewer points.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03378](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03378) |
| 42 | DARB-Splatting: Generalizing Splatting with Decaying Anisotropic Radial Basis Functions | Vishagar Arunan,Saeedha Nazar,Hashiru Pramuditha,Vinasirajan Viruthshaan,Sameera Ramasinghe,Simon Lucey,Ranga Rodrigo | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Splatting-based 3D reconstruction methods have gained popularity with the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting, efficiently synthesizing high-quality novel views. These methods commonly resort to using exponential family functions, such as the Gaussian function, as reconstruction kernels due to their anisotropic nature, ease of projection, and differentiability in rasterization. However, the field remains restricted to variations within the exponential family, leaving generalized reconstruction kernels largely underexplored, partly due to the lack of easy integrability in 3D to 2D projections. In this light, we show that a class of decaying anisotropic radial basis functions (DARBFs), which are non-negative functions of the Mahalanobis distance, supports splatting by approximating the Gaussian function's closed-form integration advantage. With this fresh perspective, we demonstrate up to 34% faster convergence during training and a 15% reduction in memory consumption across various DARB reconstruction kernels, while maintaining comparable PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS results. We will make the code available.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12369](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12369) |
| 41 | DehazeGS: Seeing Through Fog with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Jinze Yu,Yiqun Wang,Zhengda Lu,Jianwei Guo,Yong Li,Hongxing Qin,Xiaopeng Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Current novel view synthesis tasks primarily rely on high-quality and clear images. However, in foggy scenes, scattering and attenuation can significantly degrade the reconstruction and rendering quality. Although NeRF-based dehazing reconstruction algorithms have been developed, their use of deep fully connected neural networks and per-ray sampling strategies leads to high computational costs. Moreover, NeRF's implicit representation struggles to recover fine details from hazy scenes. In contrast, recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction by explicitly modeling point clouds into 3D Gaussians. In this paper, we propose leveraging the explicit Gaussian representation to explain the foggy image formation process through a physically accurate forward rendering process. We introduce DehazeGS, a method capable of decomposing and rendering a fog-free background from participating media using only muti-view foggy images as input. We model the transmission within each Gaussian distribution to simulate the formation of fog. During this process, we jointly learn the atmospheric light and scattering coefficient while optimizing the Gaussian representation of the hazy scene. In the inference stage, we eliminate the effects of scattering and attenuation on the Gaussians and directly project them onto a 2D plane to obtain a clear view. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world foggy datasets demonstrate that DehazeGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both rendering quality and computational efficiency. visualizations are available at https://dehazegs.github.io/</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03659](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03659) |

However, its rendering quality deteriorates with sparse inphut views, leading to distorted content and reduced details. This limitation hinders its practical application. To address this issue, we propose a sparse-view 3DGS method. Given the inherently ill-posed nature of sparse-view rendering, incorporating prior information is crucial. We propose a semantic regularization technique, using features extracted from the pretrained DINO-ViT model, to ensure multi-view semantic consistency. Additionally, we propose local depth regularization, which constrains depth values to improve generalization on unseen views.

| 39 | RDG-GS: Relative Depth Guidance with Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Sparse-View 3D Rendering | Chenlu Zhan,Yufei Zhang,Yu Lin,Gaoang Wang,Hongwei Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Efficiently synthesizing novel views from sparse inputs while maintaining accuracy remains a critical challenge in 3D reconstruction. While advanced techniques like radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve rendering quality and impressive efficiency with dense view inputs, they suffer from significant geometric reconstruction errors when applied to sparse input views. Moreover, although recent methods leverage monocular depth estimation to enhance geometric learning, their dependence on single-view estimated depth often leads to view inconsistency issues across different viewpoints. Consequently, this reliance on absolute depth can introduce inaccuracies in geometric information, ultimately compromising the quality of scene reconstruction with Gaussian splats. In this paper, we present RDG-GS, a novel sparse-view 3D rendering framework with Relative Depth Guidance based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. The core innovation lies in utilizing relative depth guidance to refine the Gaussian field, steering it towards view-consistent spatial geometric representations, thereby enabling the reconstruction of accurate geometric structures and capturing intricate textures. First, we devise refined depth priors to rectify the coarse estimated depth and insert global and fine-grained scene information to regular Gaussians. Building on this, to address spatial geometric inaccuracies from absolute depth, we propose relative depth guidance by optimizing the similarity between spatially correlated patches of depth and images. Additionally, we also directly deal with the sparse areas challenging to converge by the adaptive sampling for quick densification. Across extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF360, LLFF, DTU, and Blender, RDG-GS demonstrates state-of-the-art rendering quality and efficiency, making a significant advancement for real-world application.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11102](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11102) |

However, the 3D Gaussians learned by 3D-GS have ambiguous structures without any geometry constraints. This inherent issue in 3D-GS leads to a rough boundary when segmenting individual objects. To remedy these problems, we propose SAGD, a conceptually simple yet effective boundary-enhanced segmentation pipeline for 3D-GS to improve segmentation accuracy while preserving segmentation speed. Specifically, we introduce a Gaussian Decomposition scheme, which ingeniously utilizes the special structure of 3D Gaussian, finds out, and then decomposes the boundary Gaussians. Moreover, to achieve fast interactive 3D segmentation, we introduce a novel training-free pipeline by lifting a 2D foundation model to 3D-GS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality 3D segmentation without rough boundary issues, which can be easily applied to other scene editing tasks.</details> | January 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17857](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17857) |
| 37 | Decoupling Appearance Variations with 3D Consistent Features in Gaussian Splatting | Jiaqi Lin,Zhihao Li,Binxiao Huang,Xiao Tang,Jianzhuang Liu,Shiyong Liu,Xiaofei Wu,Fenglong Song,Wenming Yang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a prominent 3D representation in novel view synthesis, but it still suffers from appearance variations, which are caused by various factors, such as modern camera ISPs, different time of day, weather conditions, and local light changes. These variations can lead to floaters and color distortions in the rendered images/videos. Recent appearance modeling approaches in Gaussian Splatting are either tightly coupled with the rendering process, hindering real-time rendering, or they only account for mild global variations, performing poorly in scenes with local light changes. In this paper, we propose DAVIGS, a method that decouples appearance variations in a plug-and-play and efficient manner. By transforming the rendering results at the image level instead of the Gaussian level, our approach can model appearance variations with minimal optimization time and memory overhead. Furthermore, our method gathers appearance-related information in 3D space to transform the rendered images, thus building 3D consistency across views implicitly. We validate our method on several appearance-variant scenes, and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with minimal training time and memory usage, without compromising rendering speeds. Additionally, it provides performance improvements for different Gaussian Splatting baselines in a plug-and-play manner.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10788](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10788) |

Our approach estimates 3D object-level changes by comparing two sets of unaligned images taken at different times. Leveraging 3DGS's novel view rendering and EfficientSAM's zero-shot segmentation capabilities, we detect 2D object-level changes, which are then associated and fused across views to estimate 3D change masks and object transformations. Our method can accurately identify changes in cluttered environments using sparse (as few as one) post-change images within as little as 18s. It does not rely on depth input, user instructions, pre-defined object classes, or object models -- An object is recognized simply if it has been re-arranged. Our approach is evaluated on both public and self-collected real-world datasets, achieving up to 14% higher accuracy and three orders of magnitude faster performance compared to the state-of-the-art radiance-field-based change detection method. This significant performance boost enables a broad range of downstream applications, where we highlight three key use cases: object reconstruction, robot workspace reset, and 3DGS model update.

Many current 3D scene generation methods rely on pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and monocular depth estimators. However, the generated scenes occupy large amounts of storage space and often lack effective regularisation methods, leading to geometric distortions. To this end, we propose BloomScene, a lightweight structured 3D Gaussian splatting for crossmodal scene generation, which creates diverse and high-quality 3D scenes from text or image inputs. Specifically, a crossmodal progressive scene generation framework is proposed to generate coherent scenes utilizing incremental point cloud reconstruction and 3D Gaussian splatting. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical depth prior-based regularization mechanism that utilizes multi-level constraints on depth accuracy and smoothness to enhance the realism and continuity of the generated scenes. Ultimately, we propose a structured context-guided compression mechanism that exploits structured hash grids to model the context of unorganized anchor attributes, which significantly eliminates structural redundancy and reduces storage overhead. Comprehensive experiments across multiple scenes demonstrate the significant potential and advantages of our framework compared with several baselines.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10462](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10462) |

However, existing vision-only 3D-GS methods often rely on hand-crafted heuristics for point-cloud densification and face challenges in handling occlusions and high GPU memory and computation consumption. LiDAR-Inertial-Visual (LIV) sensor configuration has demonstrated superior performance in localization and dense mapping by leveraging complementary sensing characteristics: rich texture information from cameras, precise geometric measurements from LiDAR, and high-frequency motion data from IMU. Inspired by this, we propose a novel real-time Gaussian-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. Our map system comprises a global Gaussian map and a sliding window of Gaussians, along with an IESKF-based odometry. The global Gaussian map consists of hash-indexed voxels organized in a recursive octree, effectively covering sparse spatial volumes while adapting to different levels of detail and scales. The Gaussian map is initialized through multi-sensor fusion and optimized with photometric gradients. Our system incrementally maintains a sliding window of Gaussians, significantly reducing GPU computation and memory consumption by only optimizing the map within the sliding window. Moreover, we implement a tightly coupled multi-sensor fusion odometry with an iterative error state Kalman filter (IESKF), leveraging real-time updating and rendering of the Gaussian map. Our system represents the first real-time Gaussian-based SLAM framework deployable on resource-constrained embedded systems, demonstrated on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX platform. The framework achieves real-time performance while maintaining robust multi-sensor fusion capabilities. All implementation algorithms, hardware designs, and CAD models will be publicly available.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08672](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08672) |
| 31 | SplatMAP: Online Dense Monocular SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting | Yue Hu,Rong Liu,Meida Chen,Peter Beerel,Andrew Feng | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Achieving high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of traditional methods like Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and monocular SLAM in accurately capturing scene details. While differentiable rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) address some of these challenges, their high computational costs make them unsuitable for real-time applications. Additionally, existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods often focus on photometric consistency, neglecting geometric accuracy and failing to exploit SLAM's dynamic depth and pose updates for scene refinement. We propose a framework integrating dense SLAM with 3DGS for real-time, high-fidelity dense reconstruction. Our approach introduces SLAM-Informed Adaptive Densification, which dynamically updates and densifies the Gaussian model by leveraging dense point clouds from SLAM. Additionally, we incorporate Geometry-Guided Optimization, which combines edge-aware geometric constraints and photometric consistency to jointly optimize the appearance and geometry of the 3DGS scene representation, enabling detailed and accurate SLAM mapping reconstruction. Experiments on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results among monocular systems. Specifically, our method achieves a PSNR of 36.864, SSIM of 0.985, and LPIPS of 0.040 on Replica, representing improvements of 10.7%, 6.4%, and 49.4%, respectively, over the previous SOTA. On TUM-RGBD, our method outperforms the closest baseline by 10.2%, 6.6%, and 34.7% in the same metrics.

Traditional methods, such as empirical models and ray tracing, often fall short, either due to insufficient details or because of challenges for real-time applications. Inspired by the newly proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting method in the computer vision domain, which outperforms other methods in reconstructing optical radiance fields, we propose RF-3DGS, a novel approach that enables precise site-specific reconstruction of radio radiance fields from sparse samples. RF-3DGS can render radio spatial spectra at arbitrary positions within 2 ms following a brief 3-minute training period, effectively identifying dominant propagation paths. Furthermore, RF-3DGS can provide fine-grained Spatial Channel State Information (Spatial-CSI) of these paths, including the channel gain, the delay, the angle of arrival (AoA), and the angle of departure (AoD). Our experiments, calibrated through real-world measurements, demonstrate that RF-3DGS not only significantly improves reconstruction quality, training efficiency, and rendering speed compared to state-of-the-art methods, but also holds great potential for supporting wireless communication and advanced applications such as Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC). Code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/SunLab-UGA/RF-3DGS.</details> | November 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19420](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19420) |
| 29 | 3D Gaussian Splatting with Normal Information for Mesh Extraction and Improved Rendering | Meenakshi Krishnan,Liam Fowl,Ramani Duraiswami | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Differentiable 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as an efficient and flexible rendering technique for representing complex scenes from a collection of 2D views and enabling high-quality real-time novel-view synthesis. However, its reliance on photometric losses can lead to imprecisely reconstructed geometry and extracted meshes, especially in regions with high curvature or fine detail. We propose a novel regularization method using the gradients of a signed distance function estimated from the Gaussians, to improve the quality of rendering while also extracting a surface mesh. The regularizing normal supervision facilitates better rendering and mesh reconstruction, which is crucial for downstream applications in video generation, animation, AR-VR and gaming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on datasets such as Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep-Blending. Our method scores higher on photorealism metrics compared to other mesh extracting rendering methods without compromising mesh quality.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08370](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08370) |
| 28 | VINGS-Mono: Visual-Inertial Gaussian Splatting Monocular SLAM in Large Scenes | Ke Wu,Zicheng Zhang,Muer Tie,Ziqing Ai,Zhongxue Gan,Wenchao Ding | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>VINGS-Mono is a monocular (inertial) Gaussian Splatting (GS) SLAM framework designed for large scenes. The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08286](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08286) |

Zhang,Natalia Neverova,Andrea Vedaldi,Roman Shapovalov,David Novotny | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce Uncommon Objects in 3D (uCO3D), a new object-centric dataset for 3D deep learning and 3D generative AI. uCO3D is the largest publicly-available collection of high-resolution videos of objects with 3D annotations that ensures full-360$^{\\circ}$ coverage. uCO3D is significantly more diverse than MVImgNet and CO3Dv2, covering more than 1,000 object categories. It is also of higher quality, due to extensive quality checks of both the collected videos and the 3D annotations. Similar to analogous datasets, uCO3D contains annotations for 3D camera poses, depth maps and sparse point clouds. In addition, each object is equipped with a caption and a 3D Gaussian Splat reconstruction. We train several large 3D models on MVImgNet, CO3Dv2, and uCO3D and obtain superior results using the latter, showing that uCO3D is better for learning applications.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07574](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07574) |

To achieve that, we extend such a model for diverse-view human head generation by fine-tuning on synthetic data and modifying its conditioning. Our avatars maintain a dense correspondence with a human face mesh template, allowing blendshape-based expression generation. This is achieved through a modified 3DGS approach, connectivity regularizers, and a strategic initialization tailored for our task. Additionally, we propose an optional efficient SDS-based correction step to refine the blendshape expressions, enhancing realism and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that Arc2Avatar achieves state-of-the-art realism and identity preservation, effectively addressing color issues by allowing the use of very low guidance, enabled by our strong identity prior and initialization strategy, without compromising detail.

| 25 | 3DGS-to-PC: Convert a 3D Gaussian Splatting Scene into a Dense Point Cloud or Mesh | Lewis A G Stuart,Michael P Pound | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels at producing highly detailed 3D reconstructions, but these scenes often require specialised renderers for effective visualisation. In contrast, point clouds are a widely used 3D representation and are compatible with most popular 3D processing software, yet converting 3DGS scenes into point clouds is a complex challenge. In this work we introduce 3DGS-to-PC, a flexible and highly customisable framework that is capable of transforming 3DGS scenes into dense, high-accuracy point clouds. We sample points probabilistically from each Gaussian as a 3D density function. We additionally threshold new points using the Mahalanobis distance to the Gaussian centre, preventing extreme outliers. The result is a point cloud that closely represents the shape encoded into the 3D Gaussian scene. Individual Gaussians use spherical harmonics to adapt colours depending on view, and each point may contribute only subtle colour hints to the resulting rendered scene. To avoid spurious or incorrect colours that do not fit with the final point cloud, we recalculate Gaussian colours via a customised image rendering approach, assigning each Gaussian the colour of the pixel to which it contributes most across all views. 3DGS-to-PC also supports mesh generation through Poisson Surface Reconstruction, applied to points sampled from predicted surface Gaussians. This allows coloured meshes to be generated from 3DGS scenes without the need for re-training. This package is highly customisable and capability of simple integration into existing 3DGS pipelines. 3DGS-to-PC provides a powerful tool for converting 3DGS data into point cloud and surface-based formats.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07478](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07478) |
| 24 | Evaluating Human Perception of Novel View Synthesis: Subjective Quality Assessment of Gaussian Splatting and NeRF in Dynamic Scenes | Yuhang Zhang,Joshua Maraval,Zhengyu Zhang,Nicolas Ramin,Shishun Tian,Lu Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Gaussian Splatting (GS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are two groundbreaking technologies that have revolutionized the field of Novel View Synthesis (NVS), enabling immersive photorealistic rendering and user experiences by synthesizing multiple viewpoints from a set of images of sparse views. The potential applications of NVS, such as high-quality virtual and augmented reality, detailed 3D modeling, and realistic medical organ imaging, underscore the importance of quality assessment of NVS methods from the perspective of human perception. Although some previous studies have explored subjective quality assessments for NVS technology, they still face several challenges, especially in NVS methods selection, scenario coverage, and evaluation methodology. To address these challenges, we conducted two subjective experiments for the quality assessment of NVS technologies containing both GS-based and NeRF-based methods, focusing on dynamic and real-world scenes. This study covers 360\xc2\xb0, front-facing, and single-viewpoint videos while providing a richer and greater number of real scenes. Meanwhile, it's the first time to explore the impact of NVS methods in dynamic scenes with moving objects. The two types of subjective experiments help to fully comprehend the influences of different viewing paths from a human perception perspective and pave the way for future development of full-reference and no-reference quality metrics. In addition, we established a comprehensive benchmark of various state-of-the-art objective metrics on the proposed database, highlighting that existing methods still struggle to accurately capture subjective quality. The results give us some insights into the limitations of existing NVS methods and may promote the development of new NVS methods.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08072](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08072) |

Given the underconstrained nature of this problem, incorporating prior knowledge is essential. Therefore, we propose a framework comprising prior learning and avatar creation phases. The prior learning phase leverages 3D head priors derived from a large-scale multi-view dynamic dataset, and the avatar creation phase applies these priors for few-shot personalization. Our approach effectively captures these priors by utilizing a Gaussian Splatting-based auto-decoder network with part-based dynamic modeling. Our method employs identity-shared encoding with personalized latent codes for individual identities to learn the attributes of Gaussian primitives. During the avatar creation phase, we achieve fast head avatar personalization by leveraging inversion and fine-tuning strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model effectively exploits head priors and successfully generalizes them to few-shot personalization, achieving photo-realistic rendering quality, multi-view consistency, and stable animation.</details> | August 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06019) |
| 22 | RMAvatar: Photorealistic Human Avatar Reconstruction from Monocular Video Based on Rectified Mesh-embedded Gaussians | Sen Peng,Weixing Xie,Zilong Wang,Xiaohu Guo,Zhonggui Chen,Baorong Yang,Xiao Dong | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce RMAvatar, a novel human avatar representation with Gaussian splatting embedded on mesh to learn clothed avatar from a monocular video. We utilize the explicit mesh geometry to represent motion and shape of a virtual human and implicit appearance rendering with Gaussian Splatting. Our method consists of two main modules: Gaussian initialization module and Gaussian rectification module. We embed Gaussians into triangular faces and control their motion through the mesh, which ensures low-frequency motion and surface deformation of the avatar. Due to the limitations of LBS formula, the human skeleton is hard to control complex non-rigid transformations. We then design a pose-related Gaussian rectification module to learn fine-detailed non-rigid deformations, further improving the realism and expressiveness of the avatar. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets, RMAvatar shows state-of-the-art performance on both rendering quality and quantitative evaluations.

Christensen,Liu Ren | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Online mapping reduces the reliance of autonomous vehicles on high-definition (HD) maps, significantly enhancing scalability. However, recent advancements often overlook cross-sensor configuration generalization, leading to performance degradation when models are deployed on vehicles with different camera intrinsics and extrinsics. With the rapid evolution of novel view synthesis methods, we investigate the extent to which these techniques can be leveraged to address the sensor configuration generalization challenge. We propose a novel framework leveraging Gaussian splatting to reconstruct scenes and render camera images in target sensor configurations. The target config sensor data, along with labels mapped to the target config, are used to train online mapping models. Our proposed framework on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrates a performance improvement of 18% through effective dataset augmentation, achieves faster convergence and efficient training, and exceeds state-of-the-art performance when using only 25% of the original training data. This enables data reuse and reduces the need for laborious data labeling.

| 20 | NVS-SQA: Exploring Self-Supervised Quality Representation Learning for Neurally Synthesized Scenes without References | Qiang Qu,Yiran Shen,Xiaoming Chen,Yuk Ying Chung,Weidong Cai,Tongliang Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Neural View Synthesis (NVS), such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, effectively creates photorealistic scenes from sparse viewpoints, typically evaluated by quality assessment methods like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. However, these full-reference methods, which compare synthesized views to reference views, may not fully capture the perceptual quality of neurally synthesized scenes (NSS), particularly due to the limited availability of dense reference views. Furthermore, the challenges in acquiring human perceptual labels hinder the creation of extensive labeled datasets, risking model overfitting and reduced generalizability. To address these issues, we propose NVS-SQA, a NSS quality assessment method to learn no-reference quality representations through self-supervision without reliance on human labels. Traditional self-supervised learning predominantly relies on the "same instance, similar representation" assumption and extensive datasets. However, given that these conditions do not apply in NSS quality assessment, we employ heuristic cues and quality scores as learning objectives, along with a specialized contrastive pair preparation process to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. The results show that NVS-SQA outperforms 17 no-reference methods by a large margin (i.e., on average 109.5% in SRCC, 98.6% in PLCC, and 91.5% in KRCC over the second best) and even exceeds 16 full-reference methods across all evaluation metrics (i.e., 22.9% in SRCC, 19.1% in PLCC, and 18.6% in KRCC over the second best).</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06488](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06488) |

Splat-Nav consists of two components: 1) Splat-Plan, a safe planning module, and 2) Splat-Loc, a robust vision-based pose estimation module. Splat-Plan builds a safe-by-construction polytope corridor through the map based on mathematically rigorous collision constraints and then constructs a B\xc3\xa9zier curve trajectory through this corridor. Splat-Loc provides real-time recursive state estimates given only an RGB feed from an on-board camera, leveraging the point-cloud representation inherent in GSplat scenes. Working together, these modules give robots the ability to recursively re-plan smooth and safe trajectories to goal locations. Goals can be specified with position coordinates, or with language commands by using a semantic GSplat. We demonstrate improved safety compared to point cloud-based methods in extensive simulation experiments. In a total of 126 hardware flights, we demonstrate equivalent safety and speed compared to motion capture and visual odometry, but without a manual frame alignment required by those methods. We show online re-planning at more than 2 Hz and pose estimation at about 25 Hz, an order of magnitude faster than Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based navigation methods, thereby enabling real-time navigation. We provide experiment videos on our project page at https://chengine.github.io/splatnav/.

However, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds, it is difficult to guarantee geometric reconstruction accuracy and multi-view consistency simply by relying on image reconstruction loss. Although many studies on surface reconstruction based on 3DGS have emerged recently, the quality of their meshes is generally unsatisfactory. To address this problem, we propose a fast planar-based Gaussian splatting reconstruction representation (PGSR) to achieve high-fidelity surface reconstruction while ensuring high-quality rendering. Specifically, we first introduce an unbiased depth rendering method, which directly renders the distance from the camera origin to the Gaussian plane and the corresponding normal map based on the Gaussian distribution of the point cloud, and divides the two to obtain the unbiased depth. We then introduce single-view geometric, multi-view photometric, and geometric regularization to preserve global geometric accuracy. We also propose a camera exposure compensation model to cope with scenes with large illumination variations. Experiments on indoor and outdoor scenes show that our method achieves fast training and rendering while maintaining high-fidelity rendering and geometric reconstruction, outperforming 3DGS-based and NeRF-based methods.</details> | June 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06521](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06521) |

However, direct 3D generation is still constrained by the scarcity and lower fidelity of 3D datasets. In this paper, we introduce Zero-1-to-G, a novel approach that addresses this problem by enabling direct single-view generation on Gaussian splats using pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our key insight is that Gaussian splats, a 3D representation, can be decomposed into multi-view images encoding different attributes. This reframes the challenging task of direct 3D generation within a 2D diffusion framework, allowing us to leverage the rich priors of pretrained 2D diffusion models. To incorporate 3D awareness, we introduce cross-view and cross-attribute attention layers, which capture complex correlations and enforce 3D consistency across generated splats. This makes Zero-1-to-G the first direct image-to-3D generative model to effectively utilize pretrained 2D diffusion priors, enabling efficient training and improved generalization to unseen objects. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate superior performance in 3D object generation, offering a new approach to high-quality 3D generation.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05427](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05427) |

Yet, existing methods often face challenges related to high memory usage, lengthy training times, and temporal consistency. To address these issues, we introduce a novel neural video representation that combines 3D Gaussian splatting with continuous camera motion modeling. By leveraging Neural ODEs, our approach learns smooth camera trajectories while maintaining an explicit 3D scene representation through Gaussians. Additionally, we introduce a spatiotemporal hierarchical learning strategy, progressively refining spatial and temporal features to enhance reconstruction quality and accelerate convergence. This memory-efficient approach achieves high-quality rendering at impressive speeds. Experimental results show that our hierarchical learning, combined with robust camera motion modeling, captures complex dynamic scenes with strong temporal consistency, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse video datasets in both high- and low-motion scenarios.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04782](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04782) |
| 15 | FatesGS: Fast and Accurate Sparse-View Surface Reconstruction using Gaussian Splatting with Depth-Feature Consistency | Han Huang,Yulun Wu,Chao Deng,Ge Gao,Ming Gu,Yu-Shen Liu | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, Gaussian Splatting has sparked a new trend in the field of computer vision. Apart from novel view synthesis, it has also been extended to the area of multi-view reconstruction. The latest methods facilitate complete, detailed surface reconstruction while ensuring fast training speed. However, these methods still require dense input views, and their output quality significantly degrades with sparse views. We observed that the Gaussian primitives tend to overfit the few training views, leading to noisy floaters and incomplete reconstruction surfaces. In this paper, we present an innovative sparse-view reconstruction framework that leverages intra-view depth and multi-view feature consistency to achieve remarkably accurate surface reconstruction. Specifically, we utilize monocular depth ranking information to supervise the consistency of depth distribution within patches and employ a smoothness loss to enhance the continuity of the distribution. To achieve finer surface reconstruction, we optimize the absolute position of depth through multi-view projection features. Extensive experiments on DTU and BlendedMVS demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a speedup of 60x to 200x, achieving swift and fine-grained mesh reconstruction without the need for costly pre-training.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04628](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04628) |

However, training a 3DGS model remains a time-intensive task, especially in load imbalance scenarios where workload diversity among pixels and Gaussian spheres causes poor renderCUDA kernel performance. We introduce Balanced 3DGS, a Gaussian-wise parallelism rendering with fine-grained tiling approach in 3DGS training process, perfectly solving load-imbalance issues. First, we innovatively introduce the inter-block dynamic workload distribution technique to map workloads to Streaming Multiprocessor(SM) resources within a single GPU dynamically, which constitutes the foundation of load balancing. Second, we are the first to propose the Gaussian-wise parallel rendering technique to significantly reduce workload divergence inside a warp, which serves as a critical component in addressing load imbalance. Based on the above two methods, we further creatively put forward the fine-grained combined load balancing technique to uniformly distribute workload across all SMs, which boosts the forward renderCUDA kernel performance by up to 7.52x. Besides, we present a self-adaptive render kernel selection strategy during the 3DGS training process based on different load-balance situations, which effectively improves training efficiency.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17378](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17378) |

However, achieving consistent stylization across both spatial and temporal dimensions remains a significant challenge. Most existing methods are designed for static scenes and often require an optimization process for each style image, limiting their adaptability. We introduce ZDySS, a zero-shot stylization framework for dynamic scenes, allowing our model to generalize to previously unseen style images at inference. Our approach employs Gaussian splatting for scene representation, linking each Gaussian to a learned feature vector that renders a feature map for any given view and timestamp. By applying style transfer on the learned feature vectors instead of the rendered feature map, we enhance spatio-temporal consistency across frames. Our method demonstrates superior performance and coherence over state-of-the-art baselines in tests on real-world dynamic scenes, making it a robust solution for practical applications.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03875](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03875) |

While traditional visual data (such as images and videos) and NeRF-based formats already have mature techniques for copyright protection, steganographic techniques for the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) format have yet to be fully explored. To address this, we propose ConcealGS, an innovative method for embedding implicit information into 3D-GS. By introducing the knowledge distillation and gradient optimization strategy based on 3D-GS, ConcealGS overcomes the limitations of NeRF-based models and enhances the robustness of implicit information and the quality of 3D reconstruction. We evaluate ConcealGS in various potential application scenarios, and experimental results have demonstrated that ConcealGS not only successfully recovers implicit information but also has almost no impact on rendering quality, providing a new approach for embedding invisible and recoverable information into 3D models in the future.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03605](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03605) |

However, its substantial data requirements present challenges for practical applications. In this paper, we introduce an efficient compression technique that significantly reduces storage overhead by using compact representation. We propose a unified architecture that combines point cloud data and feature planes through a progressive tri-plane structure. Our method utilizes 2D feature planes, enabling continuous spatial representation. To further optimize these representations, we incorporate entropy modeling in the frequency domain, specifically designed for standard video codecs. We also propose channel-wise bit allocation to achieve a better trade-off between bitrate consumption and feature plane representation. Consequently, our model effectively leverages spatial correlations within the feature planes to enhance rate-distortion performance using standard, non-differentiable video codecs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in data compactness while maintaining high rendering quality.

| 9 | Gaussian Masked Autoencoders | Jathushan Rajasegaran,Xinlei Chen,Rulilong Li,Christoph Feichtenhofer,Jitendra Malik,Shiry Ginosar | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper explores Masked Autoencoders (MAE) with Gaussian Splatting. While reconstructive self-supervised learning frameworks such as MAE learns good semantic abstractions, it is not trained for explicit spatial awareness. Our approach, named Gaussian Masked Autoencoder, or GMAE, aims to learn semantic abstractions and spatial understanding jointly. Like MAE, it reconstructs the image end-to-end in the pixel space, but beyond MAE, it also introduces an intermediate, 3D Gaussian-based representation and renders images via splatting. We show that GMAE can enable various zero-shot learning capabilities of spatial understanding (e.g., figure-ground segmentation, image layering, edge detection, etc.) while preserving the high-level semantics of self-supervised representation quality from MAE. To our knowledge, we are the first to employ Gaussian primitives in an image representation learning framework beyond optimization-based single-scene reconstructions. We believe GMAE will inspire further research in this direction and contribute to developing next-generation techniques for modeling high-fidelity visual data.

However, due to significant occlusions between hands and object as well as the high degree-of-freedom motions, it is challenging to collect and annotate a high-quality, large-scale dataset, which prevents further improvement of bimanual hand-object interaction-related baselines. In this work, we propose a new 3D Gaussian Splatting based data augmentation framework for bimanual hand-object interaction, which is capable of augmenting existing dataset to large-scale photorealistic data with various hand-object pose and viewpoints. First, we use mesh-based 3DGS to model objects and hands, and to deal with the rendering blur problem due to multi-resolution input images used, we design a super-resolution module. Second, we extend the single hand grasping pose optimization module for the bimanual hand object to generate various poses of bimanual hand-object interaction, which can significantly expand the pose distribution of the dataset. Third, we conduct an analysis for the impact of different aspects of the proposed data augmentation on the understanding of the bimanual hand-object interaction. We perform our data augmentation on two benchmarks, H2O and Arctic, and verify that our method can improve the performance of the baselines.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02845](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02845) |
| 7 | GS-DiT: Advancing Video Generation with Pseudo 4D Gaussian Fields through Efficient Dense 3D Point Tracking | Weikang Bian,Zhaoyang Huang,Xiaoyu Shi,Yijin Li,Fu-Yun Wang,Hongsheng Li | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>4D video control is essential in video generation as it enables the use of sophisticated lens techniques, such as multi-camera shooting and dolly zoom, which are currently unsupported by existing methods. Training a video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly to control 4D content requires expensive multi-view videos. Inspired by Monocular Dynamic novel View Synthesis (MDVS) that optimizes a 4D representation and renders videos according to different 4D elements, such as camera pose and object motion editing, we bring pseudo 4D Gaussian fields to video generation. Specifically, we propose a novel framework that constructs a pseudo 4D Gaussian field with dense 3D point tracking and renders the Gaussian field for all video frames. Then we finetune a pretrained DiT to generate videos following the guidance of the rendered video, dubbed as GS-DiT. To boost the training of the GS-DiT, we also propose an efficient Dense 3D Point Tracking (D3D-PT) method for the pseudo 4D Gaussian field construction. Our D3D-PT outperforms SpatialTracker, the state-of-the-art sparse 3D point tracking method, in accuracy and accelerates the inference speed by two orders of magnitude. During the inference stage, GS-DiT can generate videos with the same dynamic content while adhering to different camera parameters, addressing a significant limitation of current video generation models. GS-DiT demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and extends the 4D controllability of Gaussian splatting to video generation beyond just camera poses. It supports advanced cinematic effects through the manipulation of the Gaussian field and camera intrinsics, making it a powerful tool for creative video production.

| 6 | BeSplat: Gaussian Splatting from a Single Blurry Image and Event Stream | Gopi Raju Matta,Reddypalli Trisha,Kaushik Mitra | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Novel view synthesis has been greatly enhanced by the development of radiance field methods. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has effectively addressed key challenges, such as long training times and slow rendering speeds, typically associated with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), while maintaining high-quality reconstructions. In this work (BeSplat), we demonstrate the recovery of sharp radiance field (Gaussian splats) from a single motion-blurred image and its corresponding event stream. Our method jointly learns the scene representation via Gaussian Splatting and recovers the camera motion through Bezier SE(3) formulation effectively, minimizing discrepancies between synthesized and real-world measurements of both blurry image and corresponding event stream. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real datasets, showcasing its ability to render view-consistent, sharp images from the learned radiance field and the estimated camera trajectory. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to address this highly challenging ill-posed problem in a Gaussian Splatting framework with the effective incorporation of temporal information captured using the event stream.</details> | December 2024. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19370](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19370) |

Reconstruction-based methods create 3D scenes from driving logs and synthesize geometry-consistent driving videos through neural rendering, but their dependence on costly object annotations limits their ability to generalize to in-the-wild driving scenarios. On the other hand, generative models can synthesize action-conditioned driving videos in a more generalizable way but often struggle with maintaining 3D visual consistency. In this paper, we present DreamDrive, a 4D spatial-temporal scene generation approach that combines the merits of generation and reconstruction, to synthesize generalizable 4D driving scenes and dynamic driving videos with 3D consistency. Specifically, we leverage the generative power of video diffusion models to synthesize a sequence of visual references and further elevate them to 4D with a novel hybrid Gaussian representation. Given a driving trajectory, we then render 3D-consistent driving videos via Gaussian splatting. The use of generative priors allows our method to produce high-quality 4D scenes from in-the-wild driving data, while neural rendering ensures 3D-consistent video generation from the 4D scenes. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and street view images demonstrate that DreamDrive can generate controllable and generalizable 4D driving scenes, synthesize novel views of driving videos with high fidelity and 3D consistency, decompose static and dynamic elements in a self-supervised manner, and enhance perception and planning tasks for autonomous driving.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00601](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00601) |
| 4 | Cloth-Splatting: 3D Cloth State Estimation from RGB Supervision | Alberta Longhini,Marcel B\xc3\xbcsching,Bardienus P. Duisterhof,Jens Lundell,Jeffrey Ichnowski,M\xc3\xa5rten Bj\xc3\xb6rkman,Danica Kragic | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce Cloth-Splatting, a method for estimating 3D states of cloth from RGB images through a prediction-update framework. Cloth-Splatting leverages an action-conditioned dynamics model for predicting future states and uses 3D Gaussian Splatting to update the predicted states. Our key insight is that coupling a 3D mesh-based representation with Gaussian Splatting allows us to define a differentiable map between the cloth state space and the image space. This enables the use of gradient-based optimization techniques to refine inaccurate state estimates using only RGB supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that Cloth-Splatting not only improves state estimation accuracy over current baselines but also reduces convergence time.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01715](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01715) |
| 3 | CrossView-GS: Cross-view Gaussian Splatting For Large-scale Scene Reconstruction | Chenhao Zhang,Yuanping Cao,Lei Zhang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent method for scene representation and reconstruction, leveraging densely distributed Gaussian primitives to enable real-time rendering of high-resolution images. While existing 3DGS methods perform well in scenes with minor view variation, large view changes in cross-view scenes pose optimization challenges for these methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-view Gaussian Splatting method for large-scale scene reconstruction, based on dual-branch fusion. Our method independently reconstructs models from aerial and ground views as two independent branches to establish the baselines of Gaussian distribution, providing reliable priors for cross-view reconstruction during both initialization and densification. Specifically, a gradient-aware regularization strategy is introduced to mitigate smoothing issues caused by significant view disparities. Additionally, a unique Gaussian supplementation strategy is utilized to incorporate complementary information of dual-branch into the cross-view model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in novel view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art methods.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01695](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01695) |
| 2 | PG-SAG: Parallel Gaussian Splatting for Fine-Grained Large-Scale Urban Buildings Reconstruction via Semantic-Aware Grouping | Tengfei Wang,Xin Wang,Yongmao Hou,Yiwei Xu,Wendi Zhang,Zongqian Zhan | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a transformative method in the field of real-time novel synthesis. Based on 3DGS, recent advancements cope with large-scale scenes via spatial-based partition strategy to reduce video memory and optimization time costs. In this work, we introduce a parallel Gaussian splatting method, termed PG-SAG, which fully exploits semantic cues for both partitioning and Gaussian kernel optimization, enabling fine-grained building surface reconstruction of large-scale urban areas without downsampling the original image resolution. First, the Cross-modal model - Language Segment Anything is leveraged to segment building masks. Then, the segmented building regions is grouped into sub-regions according to the visibility check across registered images. The Gaussian kernels for these sub-regions are optimized in parallel with masked pixels. In addition, the normal loss is re-formulated for the detected edges of masks to alleviate the ambiguities in normal vectors on edges. Finally, to improve the optimization of 3D Gaussians, we introduce a gradient-constrained balance-load loss that accounts for the complexity of the corresponding scenes, effectively minimizing the thread waiting time in the pixel-parallel rendering stage as well as the reconstruction lost. Extensive experiments are tested on various urban datasets, the results demonstrated the superior performance of our PG-SAG on building surface reconstruction, compared to several state-of-the-art 3DGS-based methods.

| 1 | Deformable Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and High-Fidelity Reconstruction of Surgical Scenes | Jiwei Shan,Zeyu Cai,Cheng-Tai Hsieh,Shing Shin Cheng,Hesheng Wang | <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction of deformable surgical scenes is a critical yet challenging task. Building on recent advancements in 3D Gaussian splatting, current methods have seen significant improvements in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. However, two major limitations remain: (1) difficulty in handling irreversible dynamic changes, such as tissue shearing, which are common in surgical scenes; and (2) the lack of hierarchical modeling for surgical scene deformation, which reduces rendering speed. To address these challenges, we introduce EH-SurGS, an efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction algorithm for deformable surgical scenes. We propose a deformation modeling approach that incorporates the life cycle of 3D Gaussians, effectively capturing both regular and irreversible deformations, thus enhancing reconstruction quality. Additionally, we present an adaptive motion hierarchy strategy that distinguishes between static and deformable regions within the surgical scene. This strategy reduces the number of 3D Gaussians passing through the deformation field, thereby improving rendering speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed components. We will open-source our code upon acceptance of the paper.</details> | January 2025. | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01101](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01101) |
